# @meridian/app

Authenticated writing workspace. Keep it a thin React/TanStack Start shell over contracts, client API helpers, stores, and server-owned runtime behavior.

- Use portless URLs for browser/e2e work; do not hard-code raw dev ports.
- Keep product language writer-facing: projects, works, chapters, context, threads, agents, turns.
- No provider/database logic in components; use client API/query layers.
- Server auth/config is WorkOS AuthKit (`wos-session` cookie) and lives under `src/server/`; do not add alternate auth adapters in app code.
- No literal colors in TSX; use design tokens and app CSS utilities.
- UI work starts from existing shared primitives. When a shadcn primitive fits,
  adopt or extend its canonical API and composition in `components/ui/` instead
  of inventing a parallel component. Preserve Meridian semantic tokens, and
  keep product-specific density or variants at the usage site until they recur.
  Deviate from the shadcn basis only for a concrete behavioral or design reason,
  and keep the deviation local. Do not add hand-rolled pills, icon buttons,
  uppercase labels, rail headers, arbitrary `text-[...]`/`tracking-[...]`, or
  feature-specific style recipes unless the local component owns genuinely new
  behavior that a shared primitive cannot express.
- Preserve TipTap/Yjs document-session boundaries; do not invent a second editor sync path.
- **Local-first invariant**: state a writer authors or arranges renders from
  device-local persistence first — the network only improves it, and
  disconnect is a status, never a blocking failure. Documents already do this
  (Yjs + y-indexeddb); Editor tabs use browser-tab-local sessionStorage, and
  resource metadata/catalog checkpoints use the account IndexedDB replica.
  Works and threads do not yet have the same offline contract. Inherently-online
  surfaces (AI runtime, billing, auth) are exempt: fail loud and honest instead
  of faking offline. New persistent state must pick a tier (content / continuity /
  workbench / preference / cache) before shipping.
- **Navigate first.** Change the destination immediately. Create, persist, and
  connect in the background. Fail on that screen. Never wait for the server
  before navigation, and never bounce back because materialization lagged.
- `/_authenticated` mounts one unconditional provider tree (Query → project → thread → transport → copilot); do not gate providers by pathname.
- Settings is a routed overlay via `?settings=` on any authenticated route (`SettingsDialog` in the layout shell).
