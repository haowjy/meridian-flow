# features/chat — Turn render surface + transcript viewport

The chat frontend: assistant-turn rendering, transcript scrolling, and the
existing-thread adapters and review orchestration around shared composer
controls.

## Purpose

This directory owns the **assistant turn render surface** — the components and
partition logic that convert an ordered `Block[]` (from `@meridian/contracts` `Turn`)
into what the reader sees — and the **transcript viewport** (`TurnList.tsx`), the
single scroll container for the conversation. It is NOT the chat session,
thread management, or shared Composer and Work-control presentation — those are
adjacent concerns (`useChatThreadSession`, `components/app/composer`, and
`components/app/work-composer-controls`). Explicit existing-thread Work rebinding stays here as a Chat adapter; prospective
Home selection does not. Work management and navigation must not call or copy
the rebind adapter.

## Mental model

An assistant turn renders as a **stack of segments**, one per interrupt or
card boundary. Each segment has exactly two zones:

- **Process disclosure** (collapsed) — all reasoning, all completed activity
  runs, and (once the durable turn settles) every frontier tool operation.
  Its visible label becomes a deterministic digest when it contains tools.
- **`ActivityBlock`** (visible) — the live last activity run. After settlement,
  non-tool blocks remain visible (interrupt, helper-result, and child-report cards).

The partition keys off block order/type and the durable terminal-status
predicate. It never reads transient stream state (`isLive`, partial blocks).
At the durable status flip, tool rows move into the fold; the resulting final
frame is identical to a reload.

When a new activity run begins, the previous frontier **rolls up** into the
process fold in chronological position. Interrupts, spawn results, and child
reports end a segment; their cards remain visible after settlement even though
other tool rows fold.

The full model lives in
[`.context/turn-composition.md`](.context/turn-composition.md); one row's
anatomy and its navigation rules in
[`.context/activity-row-anatomy.md`](.context/activity-row-anatomy.md); draft receipts,
composer mode, and review state live in
[`.context/turn-edit-receipts.md`](.context/turn-edit-receipts.md),
[`.context/composer-write-mode.md`](.context/composer-write-mode.md), and
[`.context/draft-review.md`](.context/draft-review.md).

## Key rules

1. **Default-collapsed everywhere.** `Thinking` disclosures are closed by default
   whether streaming live or settled. No auto-open on streaming.
2. **Durable settlement folds process-tool rows.** `complete`, `cancelled`, and
   `error` put every segment's process-tool operations inside its fold, except
   images and artifact protocol. Live statuses keep the last activity run
   visible. Never key this decision off `isLive` or partial block content; use
   the contracts terminal-status predicate.
3. **Artifact cards stay visible.** Custom cards and segment
   boundaries (`ask_user` interrupt, spawn `helper-result`, child
   `child-report`) render through the shared `ArtifactCard` shell (`icon`/`tone`/
   `title`/`door`/`hint`/children); process tools render as `ActivityRow`. Their
   tool protocol is hidden. Later model prose is a new Thinking/Activity pair.
   Artifact protocol never folds: hidden protocol stays on the frontier behind
   the card. The two tool kinds are named in `tool-kind.ts`: an artifact's result
   is writer-facing (custom card, image); a process tool is scaffolding.
4. **Document names are doors.** `DocumentName.tsx` renders every
   writer-facing document name in the timeline and is the only place that
   decides whether one is a link. Don't add navigation to a renderer, and
   don't make a folder, pattern or skill a door. A row expands, a name
   navigates; never invert that, and never author the name button as a JSX
   child of the row button.
5. **Block render keys are positional.** Use `blockRenderKey(block)` —
   `turnId::sequence`. Never key by `block.id`. Blocks keep identity while they
   remain in one zone; frontier prose, images, and custom cards therefore do not
   remount at settlement. Tool views structurally move from the frontier into the
   process fold at settlement and may remount at that boundary.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't branch on transient streaming state in partition logic.** Durable
  terminal status is an input; `isLive`, partial-block shape, and component-local
  stream state are not.
- **Don't key by `block.id`.** ID spaces can drift between sources; positional
  identity cannot. Use `blockRenderKey`.
- **Don't duplicate tool rendering between fold and activity zone.**
  `DeliverySegments` normalizes tool protocol blocks into ToolViews for both folded
  activity runs and visible frontiers. No raw tool block should reach `TurnBlockStep`.
- **Don't auto-open process disclosures during streaming.**

## Draft-review boundary

Inline review is the only draft-review surface. It uses server-backed
Apply/Discard disposition commands; dispositions never ride browser mutation
history, even though the review editor itself stays editable. See
[`.context/draft-review.md`](.context/draft-review.md) for the lifecycle, session,
preview, and projection contracts.

## Transcript viewport (TurnList)

`TurnList.tsx` is the **single scroll owner** for the conversation. There is no
second scroll engine and no nested scroller — the viewport is one plain
`overflow-y:auto` div with `[overflow-anchor:none]` so browser scroll anchoring
doesn't compete with TanStack Virtual's own compensation.

TanStack Virtual owns **geometry** (row layout, measured heights, above-viewport
size-change compensation). `useChatFollowScroll` owns **policy** — the explicit
`follow | free` state machine. Geometry never doubles as policy state; deriving
"at bottom" per-frame from offsets is what made the pill flicker and
follow-release feel inconsistent.

Key contract: **no child component may own a scroller**. Assistant turn
rendering (`AssistantTurn.tsx`, `ProcessDisclosure.tsx`) owns only the
disclosure expand/collapse — the viewport is TurnList's invariant.
