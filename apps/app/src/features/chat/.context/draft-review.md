# Draft review

This page defines the chat-side review session, pending projection, freshness,
and draft-only-tab contracts.

## Architecture

Inline review is the only manuscript preview surface. Apply is a document-level
command that publishes the whole current draft; Discard may still
target one operation or the whole branch.
The controller is the single client review-session owner. Its reducer owns
`surface: none | inline`, the active `{ documentId, draftId }`, and inline
messages. The synchronous disposition lock is the
only pending-command source. Use controller transitions instead of pairing
local `close` calls; `exitReview` is the single clear-all path.
`DraftReviewProvider` is the convenience boundary for one Project + Work owner.
The project shell uses its lower-level split directly: it creates one persistent
Chat value (with thread authority) and one persistent Editor value (without
thread authority), then re-provides those values at sibling boundaries. The
stable Chat surface and Chat context dock share the same Chat value; viewer and
editor surfaces receive only the Editor value. A boundary never creates a
controller, and the two scope owners are never nested.

Every disposition is serialized by the session's synchronous lock
(`controller.isDisposing`): while document-level Apply or per-card/whole-branch
Discard is in flight, all mutating controls disable and a second command is
ignored rather than clearing the in-flight state. Per-card Discard routes to
the server discard mutation with
`operationIds`; the server performs reversal-peer sync. The mutation awaits the
draft-list and preview refreshes before the session releases its lock, so no
second preview-settlement timer or local pending copy is needed.

Bulk Apply/Discard is one controller command over a captured target list; the
dock does not infer command completion from busy/idle render edges. Apply
addresses the current branch rather than preview operation ids or a revision
token. The server settles the complete branch state at command time, including
writer rows created after the last preview. The client therefore treats preview
operations and revisions as evidence, not command scope. Apply/Discard failures
are session outcomes rendered by the review header rather than ignored
promises. A batch stops at its first failure; transport failures surface through
the dock's typed error state.

Cross-cutting server policy:
[whole-branch Apply](https://github.com/haowjy/meridian-flow-docs/blob/main/kb/decisions/draft-apply-whole-current-branch.md)
and
[live-only sweep projection](https://github.com/haowjy/meridian-flow-docs/blob/main/kb/decisions/ai-change-event-projections.md).

On Apply or whole-draft Discard, the controller clears the review surface so
the editor rebinds from the review branch room to the live manuscript room. The server
owns one active Work-draft branch per `(documentId, workId)`, so there is no
same-document neighbor to select after disposition. Apply has one terminal
`applied` result; partial-Apply and stale-preview response states do not exist.

Review mode is the dock's `Changes` view plus a full-width Editor; there is no
in-editor review split. `useAiDraftLauncher` submits an explicit Work/document/
draft/path command to the route-level Editor handoff rather than commanding the
ambient Chat controller. The handoff holds one provider-lifetime, latest-wins
intent, navigates atomically to its Work and manuscript path, and lets the
Editor boundary claim it only after the route command succeeds and route Work,
path, mounted document, and active draft membership all agree. Pending and
rejected commands are never advertised to the claimant. This owner sits above desktop/phone shell
selection, so a phone Chat-to-Editor transition cannot destroy the intent or
either scope controller. The phone document host publishes its resolved editable
document to that Editor value and binds the selected review room back into its
read-only `EditorView`, just as the desktop host binds its active editor. The editor's review chrome is
`features/editor/DraftReviewHeader` (above the identity bar, review-only): LEFT
"Back to live" exit and RIGHT whole-draft "Apply all" / "Discard all", all
delegating to the controller. The server owns one active Work-draft branch per
`(documentId, workId)` and aggregates every contributing thread into that
branch, so review has one active row per document. The dock's `DockChangesView`
expands the reviewed document to Discard-class cards read from the live preview.
Each card carries one hover-revealed Discard verb, the only mutating target on
the card, driving `controller.discardOperation`. Whole-branch Apply remains in
the review header so the UI cannot imply operation-scoped Apply. Discard
takes its selection from review state, so a card disposes correctly with no
manuscript mounted. Only the card-body click needs the editor: it calls
`controller.focusReviewOperation(operationId)`, which reads the review editor off
the inline-review runtime to highlight + scroll the manuscript span, and is
inert on screens with no editor.

The review editor is editable. A draft branch is a Yjs room and the writer is
one more peer in it, so ordinary TipTap input is admitted and lands in the draft
branch — never in live — alongside agent writes. Dispositions are separate:
Apply/Discard are server commands, so draft review has no per-card Undo command.
After Apply, recovery belongs to turn-receipt Undo/Redo rather than peer-mark
actions, browser Ctrl+Z, or a client mutation origin.

`useInlineReviewSync` is a plugin adapter only: it pushes server hunk models into
the TipTap inline-review extension and reports model availability identities.
The extension styles only text and blocks present in the server draft
projection; removed live content stays in the dock's compare cards so old and
proposed prose can never compose into one manuscript line. Pure deletions use
empty positional anchors with a visible seam whose focused-operation state is
emphasized, so their cards can scroll the manuscript without adding text. An active preview
without a model is an invariant violation, logged loudly and ignored safely.

The server reviewable list emits only current-generation drafts with reviewable
content. `pendingReviewDrafts` is the shared client presentation seam that
filters rows without review content and orders the remaining drafts for the dock
and inline-review launcher. Branch lifecycle status is not review evidence: a
reusable manifest branch may remain active while carrying only bookkeeping.
Closed lifecycle rows, bookkeeping-only branches, and draft-level Undo receipts
are not part of this boundary.

See the
[requirements doc](https://github.com/haowjy/meridian-flow-docs/blob/main/work/human-undo-affordance/requirements.md)
for product decisions and the
[editable draft review authority decision](https://github.com/haowjy/meridian-flow-docs/blob/main/kb/decisions/draft-review-editable-branch.md)
for cross-cutting architecture.

The preview describes the branch-vs-live delta and supplies navigation evidence;
it does not scope Apply. Apply always settles the server's current branch.

## Draft review freshness

`DraftReviewProvider` owns the client cache freshness contract for mounted inline
reviews. When an inline review has a mounted review `DocumentSession`, any Yjs
update in that branch room invalidates both:

- the active draft preview query, so the editor rail/hunks re-derive from the
  latest server review model; and
- the work draft list query, so the composer dock reflects updated draft counts
  without closing and reopening review.

This subscription is a freshness seam only. The TipTap/Yjs session remains the
single document-sync path; the provider never interprets update contents or builds
a second draft model.

Preview refresh remains presentation freshness. Apply does not send a
`draftRevisionToken` or operation set; the server branch is the command
authority.

## The pending signal and draft-only tab lifecycle

**One client pending projection; one server authority.**
`pendingReviewDrafts(group)` in `docked-drafts.ts` is the per-document client
"has changes to review" derivation. `pendingReviewDraft` selects its newest
draft, while `activeDockedDraftGroups` projects all pending groups once for
composer surfaces. The dock's pending rows, the identity bar's
`DraftReviewChip` (self-contained; hides itself during that document's inline
review so it never coexists with `DraftReviewHeader`), and the mode selector's
fast-path count all derive from this filter. Never grow a second client
is-pending derivation.

The client projection never authorizes Draft → Auto-apply. The server's
`work-draft-pending` classifier independently supplies the review list,
authoritative content-branch count, and confirmed apply plan. Keeping those
server operations on one classifier prevents the shipped disagreement where the
dock showed no reviewable change but the mode-switch dialog raw-counted one
manifest journal row.

Pending membership and presentation order are separate contracts.
`activeDockedDraftGroups` stays newest-updated-first for the DraftDock. The
composer's single **Review changes** action sorts a copy by
`documentName ?? documentId` and opens the alphabetically first pending
document; it must not reorder the shared projection.

**Draft-only tabs.** A NEW document proposed by a draft is real (documents
row + Yjs state) but absent from the live tree until Apply. Its review tab
is synthesized by the launcher (`context-tab-from-draft.ts`) and marked
`draftOnly`, from the server's `isNewDocument` flag — derived per list
request from manifest membership (in the work manifest, not the live one),
never stored. Local disposition events and remote membership reconciliation
both route through narrow coordinator commands. Apply calls
`applyDraftMetadata(projectId, reviewWorkId, documentId)`; discard calls
`discardDraft(projectId, reviewWorkId, documentId)`. The coordinator checks the
owning Work before changing the workspace.
The synthesized tab carries that transient `reviewWorkId`; it is not document
location identity and is never persisted. A different Work reviewing the same
project document therefore cannot resolve this Work's draft-only tab.

- Every Apply path materializes the whole branch and clears draft metadata —
  keep the tab, drop the marker — after the awaited draft-list refresh but while
  the disposition lock remains held. Controls must not re-enable before that
  local resolution; draft-group absence alone cannot distinguish Apply from
  Discard.
- Whole-draft Discard removes the owning draft-only tab through the coordinator.
- When a selected row disappears remotely from the active-only list, the
  provider forces a fresh live-manuscript manifest read. Membership means
  Apply metadata resolution; absence means coordinator discard. A failed read leaves the tab
  intact, and a replacement active draft for that document cancels resolution.
- A live-tree `openTab` refresh clears a stale marker. `saveLastContextRoute`
  skips draftOnly tabs so a discarded path can't replay on the next visit;
  the coordinator repairs the route when disposition removes the route-active tab.

Server-side twin: discarding a new-document draft also removes its entry from
the work manifest branch. Later Apply operations publish the manifest as well as
document content, so a discarded entry must not remain in that branch.
