/**
 * read-payload — turns what the `read` tool returned into what the
 * writer sees.
 *
 * The payload is the model's view of a document: one hashline per block, or,
 * for an outline read, headings interleaved with the locator lines the model
 * uses to read further. Both are addressing machinery. Neither is prose the
 * writer wrote, so both are stripped here rather than in a renderer.
 *
 * This payload is serialized by this system, so it reads through
 * {@link splitHashline} rather than the anchored stripper: a block whose hash
 * came through empty serializes as `|body`, and an anchored prefix match
 * correctly refuses to touch that, which would leak a leading pipe into the
 * writer's prose and lose an empty-hash heading entirely. The anchored
 * stripper belongs at genuinely mixed seams, like `search` excerpts, which come
 * back as raw markdown for every scheme with no hashline shadow.
 *
 * Targeting is resolved server-side, so the payload already *is* the region the
 * model asked for. That makes the preview rule the same for a bare read and a
 * scoped one: show the top of what came back. No location prediction, no
 * per-command branching.
