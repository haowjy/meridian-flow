/**
 * command-descriptor — everything the timeline says and shows about one
 * command, in one exhaustive table.
 *
 * `tool-command.ts` answers *which command is this*. This module answers *what
 * do we do with it*: the glyph, whether it changed the document, both tenses of
 * its verb, what a failure is called, and what the row says when the command
 * named no document. Those five used to be five switches in three files, so
 * adding a command meant finding all of them and a wrong failure verb was
 * invisible. One entry per command now, and `Record<ToolCommand, ...>` makes a
 * missing entry a type error.
 *
 * Every copy field is a function because Lingui's `t` resolves against the
 * active locale when it runs. A table of top-level strings would freeze the
 * catalog at module load.
