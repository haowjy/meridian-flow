/**
 * Review prose width — the left rail's transient yield while inline review runs.
 *
 * Only the Editor screen has a manuscript for the inline diff to land on, and
 * there review wants the rail's width for the prose. That yield is DERIVED from
 * `inlineReview !== null`: the shell renders the rail collapsed without ever
 * writing the writer's saved rail preference, so the preference reappears by
 * itself when review exits. Nothing is captured on entry, so a second draft
 * opened mid-review or a project change underneath cannot leave a stale
 * snapshot behind (the defect this replaced).
 *
 * The one stateful bit is the escape hatch: an explicit expand while review is
 * running releases the yield for the rest of that review, so the rail toggle is
 * never a dead control. The yield re-arms the next time review opens.
