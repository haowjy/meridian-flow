/**
 * ActivityRow — the visual primitive for one entry in an assistant turn's
 * activity timeline.
 *
 * Replaces the card-altitude `ToolCard` with a text-altitude row matching the
 * design system's "text, not a card" disclosure altitude. Used by every
 * block kind in `ActivityBlock`: tools, reasoning, prose fallbacks.
 *
 * Two layout modes from one component — picked by props, not a `mode` enum:
 *
 *  1. **Action layout** (`title` set) — a single-line `icon + title + status
 *     + chevron` row. Used by tool rows and other "verb noun" actions. If
 *     `expand` is set, clicking the row toggles an inline curated fold.
 *
 *  2. **Prose layout** (`children` set, no `title`) — `icon + paragraph`
 *     side-by-side, so a multiline reasoning block aligns the prose against
 *     the icon's baseline instead of stacking under it. This was the misalign
 *     bug in v1: rendering `<icon-only-row>` then `<prose-block>` with a left
 *     pad below the icon left a gap between the icon and the first line.
 *
 * **Two actions, one row (the stretched-button pattern).** A row both expands
 * and, where its title names a document, navigates. The large forgiving target
 * carries the safe reversible action (expand); the small precise target
 * carries the consequential one (leaving the transcript). So the toggle is an
 * empty absolutely-positioned button rendered *after* the title content, and
 * any door inside the title sits above it. They are DOM siblings, never
 * nested: a `<button>` authored inside a `<button>` in JSX is not rescued the
 * way the HTML parser rescues static markup, and it breaks screen readers.
 * The stretched area covers the title row only, so clicking inside an open
 * expand never collapses it.
 *
 * **Timeline rail (self-contained).** Each row paints its own piece of the
 * Claude-style process timeline inside the icon column: the chip sits at the
 * top and a 1px `flex-1` span fills the remaining vertical space down to the
 * row's bottom edge. Because the icon column stretches to the full row height
 * (parent uses `items-stretch`) and rows stack with no margin between them,
 * the line in row N visually meets the icon in row N+1 — producing a
 * continuous rail without any sibling-aware CSS, data attributes, pseudo-
 * elements, or stacking-context tricks. Text blocks render outside this
 * component as full-width prose, so they naturally break the rail.
 *
 * Why self-contained: an earlier version used `[data-activity-row]` plus
 * `:has(+)` and adjacent-sibling pseudo-elements. That worked only when every
 * row was a *direct* DOM sibling, which broke as soon as a wrapper appeared
 * between runs (e.g. `<div data-fold-activity-run>` around tool runs while
 * reasoning runs render as fragments). Pulling the rail into the row itself
 * makes the structural assumption local — the row owns the rail, the
 * surrounding markup is free to nest however it wants. The
 * `data-activity-row` attribute survives only as a stable test/structural
 * marker for "this is one rendered timeline row" — no CSS keys off it.
