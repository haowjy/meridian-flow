# Project workspace

This feature composes the authenticated project workspace: desktop and phone
shells, route-controlled destinations, shared rails, and project-scoped
screens. Chat, editor, and context domain behavior stays with those features.

- Keep route state and destination ownership in the project route boundary;
  child surfaces render through controlled controllers rather than writing
  URLs.
- Preserve persistent desktop surfaces across destination changes; do not
  reparent, portal, or conditionally remove them to change layout.
- Treat Work as catalog and chat binding as explicit composer-owned state;
  navigation and Work management never rebind a chat implicitly.
- Path `/chat/{id}` is identity, not a primary-list lookup. Query `?chat=`
  still drops missing primaries.
- Project identity is its route UUID plus the current mutable title. Keep rename
  in workspace chrome, use React Query for optimistic propagation, and never
  couple title edits to browser or context-URI slug identity.

Read [`.context/CONTEXT.md`](.context/CONTEXT.md) before changing project shell
layout, routing, rails, headers, or project-scoped state.
