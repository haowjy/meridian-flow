/**
 * Project-route composition for document doors: what happens to passage state
 * every time the writer opens one.
 *
 * **Every door reports here, passage or not.** A door is the moment the writer
 * changes their mind about where they are, and that has to retire whatever the
 * last door was still resolving — otherwise a slow passage lookup lands a
 * highlight, or raises "that passage changed", in a document the writer left
 * two clicks ago. Making only passage doors visible to the coordinator left
 * ordinary doors unable to cancel anything, and let a stale notice sit under a
 * later, perfectly good landing.
 *
 * Routing is not this hook's job: the door has already made it, and the
 * document opens whether or not the passage survives. What is left is
 * resolving the path to a document id (the tree is the only place that mapping
 * lives), handing the anchor to the editor runtime, and reporting the one
 * outcome the writer needs to hear about.
