# Project context state machines

## Live document binding

One host's hold on an open document (`LiveDocumentBindingState` in
`use-live-document-binding.ts`). A host is a pane that shows a document. It asks the opener
(`ProjectDocumentLiveOpener`) to admit the document, then binds the admission: the live
document session plus a `release()`.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> absent: no document id
  [*] --> opening: a document id
  absent --> opening: a document id arrives
  opening --> opened: the document is admitted and this host binds it
  opening --> failed: unavailable, or the open threw
  failed --> opening: retry
  opened --> opening: the document id changes
  opening --> absent: the document id is cleared
  opened --> absent: the document id is cleared
  failed --> absent: the document id is cleared
```

- **Leaving `opened` releases the binding**, and an open that finishes after its effect was
  torn down releases what it bound instead of publishing it. A binding that is never released
  keeps the document's room alive.
- **A cancelled open is not a failure.** Account shutdown cancels opens without aborting the
  effect, and the state stays `opening` through teardown.
- `failed` keeps the reason the opener gave, so the surface can tell "not available to you"
  from "could not be opened".
