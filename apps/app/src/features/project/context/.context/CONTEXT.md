React Query acquires compact catalog snapshots and whole-commit deltas into one
normalized stable-ID cache. One QueryClient-scoped high-water coordinator makes
focus, polling, reconnect, hints, and multiple consumers join the same cursor
drain. Applied revision advances only through contiguous whole commits; observed
head can lead it while a bounded replay has more pages. Tree and picker are
projections over those same entry objects.
Mutations invalidate the affected catalog scope on success. Delete admits its
exact evidence to live removal authority first; cache absence never supplies
deletion evidence. Foreground identity saves and
background untitled create/move reconciliation share
`context-identity-mutation.ts`; every successful receipt invalidates its
materialized tree or both move endpoints, even when no tab is open.

The project availability coordinator watches server-backed tabs, bound route
selection, retained sessions, and capped recent routes by stable file ID. Exact
delete receipts enter it directly; explicit authorization-loss observers and
focus, online, and bounded polling recheck watched identities. A catalog wake
for a cold Work triggers the same exact-ID availability path without warming a
second tree. Cache omission is presentation state and never removal evidence.
Generation-bearing final commands own the atomic tab, route, selection,
admission, working-set, and Yjs session effects; same-ID moves and local-new
tabs survive. Opening requires exact final availability plus a live opener and
admission.

`useFileSuggestions` projects directly from the normalized scope views. It
never walks or caches a second recursive tree and never adds a server-search path; hosts constrain
schemes and file/directory kinds, then mount the presentation-only list.

Desktop scheme/query orchestration lives in `ContextTreePanel`; `ContextTreeRows`
selects each expanded row's direct children by stable parent ID through one
scheme-scoped environment. Mobile renders one level at a time via route params.

## Editor tabs and untitled documents

The writer-facing destination is **Editor**. One account-scoped,
framework-independent `ContextRemovalCoordinator` owns every live removal
transition: explicit close, generation-bearing terminal availability, Work pruning,
and draft discard. Account construction precedes authenticated descendants; device
desk hydration starts afterward and never gates the visible shell. A project becomes
live after its desk state reconciles, concrete Editor Work readiness, and one raw
bootstrap/validation operation. Strict replay and pre-live Work interruption adopt
that operation with fresh attempt tokens; after first completion, Work interruption
only suspends the live host and can never restore raw bootstrap authority.
The leaf route host registers first, then the rendered desktop or phone document host
settles revisioned route identity in layout phase.

Committed delete receipts carry the server-confirmed exact ID batch and availability
generation directly into the project availability coordinator before tree invalidation.
That generation-fenced coordinator normalizes the IDs and emits one deterministic
`terminal-remove` batch; it is the sole server-deletion authority. Candidate identity
remains a pure typed selection/obligation protocol for represented local transitions:
browser locators own only their revision while admitted continuity independently owns
memory and persistence. Receipt cardinality supplies no identity, and late or
superseded settlement cannot repair a newer route. The protocol emits exact planning
or one typed candidate rejection, never a generic promotion.
The pure `context-removal-planner.ts` keeps eligibility and desk/route continuity
policy separate from browser lifecycle and effects. Bound selection anchors visible
identity and exact removal; only revision-checked desk or route-only activation admits
ordinary continuity. Work change chooses a compatible admitted fallback independently
from its new route candidate. Same-Work screen leave discards selection while retaining
admitted continuity. Fulfilled absence runs one coordinator-owned rejection plan that
atomically selects a desk fallback, reconciles the working set, updates admitted memory,
publishes, and then issues guarded replace-navigation. Project-host release drops only
the detachable route adapter and mounted selection. Account-owned revision, terminal
exact removal, admitted memory, and fence authority survive re-entry; a matching
terminal removal blocks stale identity re-entry until exact rejection or a different
identity is proven. Account disposal destroys it.
The account provider owns one reversible coordinator lifetime lease. Cleanup
suspends command authority synchronously; Strict effect replay resumes that same
coordinator before child layout work, while a deferred step only finalizes a lease
that remained suspended.
Activation uses selection and transition revision tickets in layout phase. Desktop
validates live desk membership; phone validates the exact registered route without
fabricating a tab. `ContextPaneController`
remains a view/activation controller and owns no lifecycle-removal policy. Later ready
Work changes use the coordinator's supersession transition. Draft apply only resolves tab metadata. Context-tree
cache state is presentation metadata and never authorizes removal. `ContextTab` has three variants: `tracked`,
`viewer`, and the local `{ kind: "new", documentId, workId }` placeholder. A new tab captures its
canonical Work owner at creation; projection, activation, fallback, pending materialization, and Work
pruning read that stored fact rather than the currently selected Work. Empty-path Scratch remains local-only
and is never a working-set route. A new tab uses an ordinary `DocumentSession` from its first render, created detached so
Y.Doc + IndexedDB exist without opening an unauthorized server room.

The device Context desk persists one exact `selectedTabIdByWork` entry per Work.
There is no project-wide active-tab slot. One pure desk-route resolver supplies
render, bind, activation, and guarded materialization redirect identity; desk
selection is not admission. Every non-draft local `new` tab is persisted
immediately. Materialization retains `origin: "local-untitled"` across reload and
Work navigation, while explicit close/deletion and fulfilled bootstrap absence
still remove it. Server working-set bootstrap merges validated device-owned
`new` and local-origin tabs by document ID without promoting them into recency.

`untitled-reconciler.ts` is the browser-independent materialization executor;
`untitled-reconciler-browser.ts` binds APIs, the account-local owner, and React
hooks. The account/project/document-qualified `LocalUntitledOwner` record is
the sole durable pre-authority work source, including its monotonic work
revision, materialization phase and result, desired identity, failure receipt,
home, and pending timestamp. Explicit writer actions and recovery receipts are
therefore crash-safe. Reconciliation re-reads the live revision after every
await; an attempt may clear identity work or drain a record only when that exact
revision is still current, so the last explicit writer identity wins. Events
only schedule the same deferred, idempotent sweep. The sweep creates through
`create-untitled`, attaches the existing Y.Doc, waits for confirmed provider
sync, then drains the entry. A closed tab is not special: the same entry drives
a headless attach/flush. A never-materialized empty is the only path that clears
IndexedDB. A foreign UUID conflict clones the Yjs state into a newly minted
detached session and replaces the new tab's identity in place before retrying.
Named/viewed documents never enter this engine. Naming an otherwise-empty new document is itself pending materialization work: the explicit identity keeps the tab reload-safe and is applied immediately after the row is created.

After create returns, the placeholder becomes a normal route-owned `tracked`
tab in place. `provisionalName` comes from the tree DTO and drives the identity
bar's provisional state; a cached tree refetch refreshes open-tab metadata so a
cross-device rename eventually dissolves the state without another invalidation
channel. Desk-restored `new` tabs retain their sessions in explicit detached
mode; no transport is created before the server row exists. Successful
materialization restarts any terminal pre-row session before attaching and
waiting for durable sync.
Before materialization, active `new` tabs are projected from the desk store,
not reconstructed from `scheme`/`path` search params. New-tab navigation still
uses the canonical Scratch empty route, but a fresh project with no prior scheme
can activate its local editor immediately.

## Document identity bar

`DocumentIdentityBar.tsx` is the one identity surface: a fixed-height mono
breadcrumb band (`Scratch › Untitled 4`) at the top of the active tab's canvas,
on every document — tracked, provisional, viewer. Crumb/field text is `text-sm`
to match the suggestion-popover rows; `identity-bar-geometry.ts` owns the box
constants (26px band, 22px child boxes) and the zero-layout-shift contract
between rest and edit states. Provisional docs are a *state* of the bar (italic
leaf + jade “Choose a home” chip), never separate chrome; the editor banner
slot below the toolbar belongs to draft chrome alone, and identity chrome must
never occupy it again (structural separation, 2026-07-17).

The breadcrumb itself is **inert** — the chip is the only edit entry point.
Each crumb stays its own `data-seg` element because the next slice attaches a
VS Code-style per-segment navigator dropdown there; don't flatten the path
into one string.

Contracts:

- **Keystroke path**: at rest the bar renders from tab metadata only. The
  content-suggestion observer (300ms debounce, `writerOwnsName` latch) mounts
  only while the edit field is open on a provisional doc.
- **Placement grammar** (untitled docs never explicitly renamed or homed:
  provisional AND still at the default Scratch root): the jade chip opens
  an EMPTY field — the content-derived suggestion is ghost placeholder text
  (Tab/→ accepts it; Enter on an empty field accepts it implicitly). The
  popover opens on the scheme roots (Manuscript / Knowledge Base / Scratch —
  the roots ARE the context choice); picking drills into folders, building the
  home as read-only spans left of the name. Enter with a home built moves
  (+renames); name-only Enter renames in place — naming isn't homing.
  Placement happens once: any explicit save graduates the document.
- **Graduated grammar**: the same chip and field handle homed documents. The
  field opens with the current name selected, while the dropdown offers the
  current folder's siblings and every writable scheme root. Selecting a folder
  drills deeper and builds the destination prefix, so rename, move, and
  rename-plus-move remain one gesture without a second popup or name row.
- **Commit seam**: the field submits one final `{ destination, name }` to
  `use-identity-commit.ts`. That seam derives queue, no-op, or commit; every
  tracked-document commit uses the move transport so canonical collision
  locators and graduation semantics have one owner. A same-name explicit Save on a provisional
  document is therefore always a graduation, regardless of which surface
  submitted it. Conflicts return the canonical locator for Open-existing.
  Every asynchronous commit carries an operation generation. Every successful
  receipt invalidates caches; the latest receipt updates tab metadata even when
  inactive, while stale out-of-order receipts cannot overwrite it. Navigation
  additionally requires that the committed document is still the active tab.
  The field does not blur-dismiss while a save is pending.
- **Queued receipts**: a `new` tab's desired identity applies when the document
  materializes; its outcome is reconciler *state*
  (`queuedIdentityFailure(documentId)`), never a promise — the edit session is
  over when the intent is queued. A failed receipt reopens the field with the
  writer's name restored and the conflict/error recovery note; the receipt
  clears when the writer edits or leaves the field. Failures must never drop
  silently.
- **Field buttons**: the open field renders ✓/× icon buttons after it —
  additive mirrors of Enter/Esc (pointerdown is prevented so the blur-revert
  contract can't fire before the click lands). Keyboard behavior unchanged.
- **Chip slot**: right edge. The action chip is permanent (D4) and its label
  graduates with the document: jade "Choose a home" while provisional (opens
  empty placement), quiet outline "Rename" once homed (opens the same field,
  pre-filled and selected — rename is the common case, folder browsing keeps
  move discoverable). Viewer docs get the field too; uploads viewers carry no
  chip (no dead buttons). The device-only status (warning tokens,
  `TriangleAlert`) appears *beside* the action — quiet on its left, never in
  its place: placement commits queue durably offline, so device-only is
  exactly when the writer may want to file the document. It claims its spot
  after unsynced words persist for a 2s sustained grace — the clock is the
  reconciler's per-document `pendingSince`, so remounting chrome (tab
  switches) cannot restart the window. While the field is open only the
  action chip yields (the field is the action); the status stays.
- **Destination keyboard path**: ArrowDown/ArrowUp enters the suggestion list
  through its typed focus handle. Rows retain arrow wrapping and Enter select;
  folder selection can drill to arbitrary existing depth.

The tab strip still follows the settled tonal treatment: it paints nothing,
active tabs continue the canvas upward, inactive neighbors alone receive short
dividers, and the whole chip is the tab target.

## InlineNameForm semantics

The shared state machine in `use-inline-name-form.ts`. Adapters supply options;
the core owns focus, validation, and commit behavior.

**Submit:** Enter commits (unless pending or error-blocked). Escape cancels.
Blur-with-content commits (unless Escape already cancelled). Empty input =
cancel. Blocking errors refocus the input.

**Focus:** Auto-focus on mount. `requestAnimationFrame` retry handles Radix menu
focus-scope teardown — the menu's closing animation holds focus for one frame,
swallowing a same-tick `focus()`.

**Adapter differences:**

| Concern | `useCreateEntryForm` | `useRenameEntryForm` |
|---|---|---|
| initialName | `""` | `entry.name` |
| isCancelName | — | same as current name |
| siblingNames | all siblings | siblings excluding current |
| afterFocus | — | extension-aware selection |

Both adapters are ~25 lines. The shared core is ~100 lines.

## Dual-trigger caveat

Desktop right-click context and visible ellipsis overflow map one ordered action
specification through thin renderers for Radix `ContextMenu.Item` and
`DropdownMenu.Item`. They remain separate trigger primitives. The visible path
uses the neutral `OverflowMenu` and canonical trigger shared with Project chat
rows and Composer; context-specific `EntryAction` types do not cross that UI
boundary. The raw ContextMenu renderer consumes the canonical declarations from
`components/ui/dropdown-presentation.ts` directly for surface, row, separator,
destructive, density, focus, and animation paint. Do not copy those recipes or
introduce a shallow ContextMenu wrapper family merely to adapt Radix. The
visible target is 32 px for fine pointers and 44 px for coarse/no-hover input,
and it remains visible while its portaled menu is open. Mobile uses the same
context adapter with a 44 px target. Labels, icons, grouping, destructive
metadata, order, presentation, and dispatch actions therefore cannot drift.
The ellipsis stops propagation so it doesn't trigger the row's click handler.
`EntryAction` is four actions in fixed order — New file, New folder,
separator, Rename, Delete (creation first, destructive last) — identical in
both triggers. Actions dispatch from `onCloseAutoFocus`, after the menu has
fully closed with its focus return suppressed: menu teardown otherwise blurs
a freshly mounted inline row, and blur commits/cancels it.

## Creation targeting

One required `TreeCreationRequest` serves every entry point:
`{ scheme, kind, parentPath, workId }` (`TreeCreationProvider` request, or the phone
drawer's controlled mirror), with `""` meaning the scheme root. Scheme headers request the root; a folder
row requests itself; a file row requests its parent
(`parentContextEntryPath`). The single `TreeChildren` renderer inserts the
inline CreateRow at the target; the root calls it with an empty child list
before fetch, while nested folders use the same mount at child depth. Creation
explicitly reveals every target ancestor in the stored expansion model before
the request starts. Clicking any scheme or folder disclosure while the row is
open cancels creation and then performs the requested toggle; disclosure clicks
must never feel inert. Sibling-collision
validation uses the target folder's children. The captured `workId` keeps an in-flight request on its initiating Editor scope across route changes. Starting a creation anywhere
replaces a pending one; Escape/blur semantics are the shared
`useInlineNameForm` contract.

## Tree query invalidation

Deleting a file in `manuscript://` only refetches that scheme's tree for
presentation metadata. Tree absence never proves document removal. The exact
successful mutation result is the deletion evidence that the removal coordinator
receives through the project availability coordinator before tree invalidation can
affect presentation.
