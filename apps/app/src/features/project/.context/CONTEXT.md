# features/project — Desktop project shell

The authenticated project project: one persistent multi-panel desktop surface
that swaps primary *destinations* (Home / Work / Chat / Editor) without tearing down
its stateful surfaces. This file is the colocated contract for the shell — read
it before touching layout, the rails/headers, or the prefs store.
Settings is an auxiliary routed surface, not a primary destination.

Design intent lives in [`DESIGN.md` § Project shell](../../../../../../DESIGN.md).
This page is the *implementation* contract.

Mobile now lives beside this desktop shell as a sibling implementation. The
shared `ProjectView` selects `mobile/MobileProject` only through the phone
capability predicate in `usePhoneShell()`; desktop `ProjectShell` remains the
persistent multi-panel grid. Phone-specific contracts live in
[`mobile/.context/CONTEXT.md`](../mobile/.context/CONTEXT.md).

## Layout: one flat grid, stable surfaces

`layout/SlotGrid.tsx` renders the whole project as a **single flat CSS grid**.
Every stateful surface is a permanent direct child of one grid container for the
entire session. A placement change only mutates the surface wrapper's
`grid-area` (or parks it offscreen via `PARKED_SURFACE_STYLE` when inactive).
**Surfaces are never portaled, reparented, or conditionally removed by a screen
change** — that is what preserves chat scroll/draft and live document sessions
across navigation.

Slot topology (`layout/desktop-layout.ts`), one grid row across every screen:

```
"rail-l  left-resize  center  dock-resize  dock"
```

- **`rail-l`** — the left sidebar (destinations + project file tree).
- **`center`** — the destination's main pane (Home/Work route pane, or the
  Chat/Editor center surface).
- **`dock`** — the shared right dock. Chat occupies it on Home/Work/Editor; the
  context-rail occupies it on the Chat screen. It reads as **one persistent
  sidebar** whose inner content swaps — a single shared width/collapse pref
  (`slotPrefs.dock`), not a per-surface one.

There is **no `files` grid track**. The file explorer is the persistent body of
the left sidebar; `ContextViewer` owns only the Editor tab strip and document.

`LeftSidebar` is one column with a linked wordmark, Home/Work/Chat/Editor navigation,
the persistent project tree, and account controls. The navigation rows are
shared with mobile through `WorkspaceNavBody`; the wordmark and recursive tree
are desktop shell grammar.

Work is the dedicated collection/detail management destination. The collection reads
active and archived Work and owns creation and lifecycle entry points; it never selects
a project-wide Work or rebinds a chat. Its response contains only catalog Works and
never resolves or invents a Work for no-Work chats. Route-owned detail and inline metadata consume
the typed catalog, PATCH mutation, and associated-chat query seams.
Work detail owns one page-scoped metadata controller. It coordinates the active field,
authoritative returned Work, field-local failure, and an awaited Save/Discard/Keep
editing decision with the TanStack route blocker; leaves only submit intents through it.
Hard unload uses the router's native before-unload integration rather than a second
draft owner.
Incoming authoritative Work revisions update the clean baseline without replacing the
active draft. One-shot focus intents bridge detail close/delete to the collection;
they are route continuity, not Work selection or persistent state.
Detail composes identity and lifecycle, Goal, Description, pending drafts, Scratch,
Uploads, and associated chats. Associated chats use bounded cursor pages and the
same virtualized, borderless project chat row as Home without adding a nested
scroll owner. The external-scroll hook measures the list in that owner's
coordinates and owns stable keys plus focused/menu row pinning. Their membership
is historical while the displayed Work is the
chat's current primary Work. Resource sections fail independently. Archive and
unarchive preserve the detail route; delete replaces to collection and restores focus
to an adjacent row. Both shells share this route-owned module. At phone geometry, text
must wrap without horizontal overflow and product controls retain coarse-pointer touch
targets.

Home is the shared, container-responsive Composer-led entry surface on desktop
and phone, followed by the server-owned Continue, Favorites, and
cursor-paginated Recent feed. First send creates and reconciles the canonical
thread under one stable client-chosen ID before routing. Home derives the first
active, then first available, catalog Work and submits its `workId` explicitly;
loading, error, and authoritative empty catalogs remain distinct. The submitted
Work ID is an immutable reconciliation fact, along with project and Agent, and
no cache, handoff, visibility, admission, or route effect may run until the
canonical thread matches those captured facts.

The QueryClient owns one normalized Favorite record per project/thread so
navigation and stale page arrival cannot discard pending writer intent. Work
feeds remain immutable membership/order pages; only Home moves the affected
thread between its categories. Project chat lists have no read/unread or
open-acknowledgement state, and opening a chat performs no state mutation.
Thread lifecycle projection owns the independent `actionRequired` fact and
converges live and snapshot changes across Project, Home, and every matching
Work feed cache without writing Favorite.

Draft review follows the same persistent-shell rule with two sibling owners.
The hydrated project owns one Chat review value (Chat Work plus thread) and one
Editor review value (Editor Work, no thread authority) above desktop/phone
selection. Boundaries only re-provide those values: ChatSurface and the Chat
context dock share the Chat value, while viewer/editor surfaces receive the
Editor value. An explicit latest-wins route handoff carries review commands into
the matching Editor, advertises them only after route success, and claims them
only after Work, manuscript path, mounted document, and draft membership agree;
it survives phone view unmounts because the owner does not.

A chat has one current Work binding. Home's Work choice is prospective creation
state only; it never invokes the rebind command. The Chat composer may explicitly
rebind an idle existing chat through the canonical durable transition, and the
model's explicit `work.switch` command uses that same separate authority. Work
management and navigation never rebind a chat implicitly.

The desktop left rail has one divider below destination navigation. Its
Manuscript, Knowledge Base, User, Scratch, and Uploads panes are flush siblings
with transparent headers. Scratch and Uploads resolve from the shell-owned Editor Work, whose real name appears in their header tooltip and accessible control name. An explicit route Work is authoritative even while persistent Chat belongs to another Work; malformed, loading, catalog-error, and confirmed-missing explicit values never fall back to Chat or mount Work-scoped leaves. With no explicit Work, the selected thread's durable Work ID remains authoritative even when catalog display data fails. With neither an explicit Work nor a selected thread, Editor and untitled recovery derive first active, then first available, from the all-Work catalog, including archived-only catalogs; loading, error, and empty remain distinct. Uploads is intake-only and exposes no file or folder creation affordances.

### Slot paints the material; surfaces must not

Slot chrome is owned **entirely by the slot's `className`**
(`DESKTOP_PROJECT_SLOTS`). Region separation is purely **tonal** — no seam
borders, no shadows (slice-7 locked shape):

| Slot     | Material |
|----------|----------|
| `rail-l` | `shelf-surface` — the flat grey-gold shelf (chrome one shade darker) + scoped role remaps (globals.css) |
| `dock`   | `dock-surface` — the chrome material (≡ the tab band) + airlight atmosphere |
| `center` | `bg-background` |

A surface that hardcodes its **own** background overrides the slot it sits in and
produces the classic white-band / green-flash bugs (e.g. an old `bg-background`
on `ChatSurface` painting a brighter band under the dock header). **Let the slot
paint.** `SlotGrid` never branches on slot kind — chrome is pure data.

**Three-tone invariant (slice-7):** the shell is exactly three materials —
the shelf (`--color-shelf`, the chrome's grey-gold one shade darker; the
app's standard black ink, with only
contrast-failing roles remapped via `shelf-surface`'s scoped shelf-* tokens),
ONE continuous L-shaped chrome field (`--color-sidebar`: the
center cell — `chrome-field`, whose top-left rounds against the shelf on the
shared `--radius-md` — plus the entire dock, identical where they meet; the
dock alone adds the `dock-airlight` floor gradient, transparent in the band's
reach), and the lit page (`--color-background`, the brightest surface, rising
as each pane's `page-sheet`: top-right rounded on `--radius-md`, square and
flush on the rail side). **Bands never paint**: `PaneHeader`, `ContextTabBar`,
and `DockHeader` are all transparent h-10 rows on their cell's material. Only
`--color-background`, `--color-sidebar`, and `--color-sidebar-accent` may meet
at the band seam — arbitrary surface tokens there re-expose the notch wedge on
palette change. Chat|Changes in the dock is a CONTAINED
segmented track (a recessed ink-mix well whose active segment surfaces paper
inside the track's own boundary), deliberately not tab chips: only the page
rises out of a band. Two chips wear the tab grammar — the document tabs and
the centered chat header's title chip — both surfacing `--color-background`.

## One sidebar grammar (the reconciliation)

The shell once had four bespoke "sidebar + header + collapse + resize" surfaces
that had each drifted (different header heights, borders, toggle positions, label
weights, raw colors). They are now reconciled to **one reference: the left
sidebar (`shell/LeftSidebar.tsx`).** New surfaces follow it. The load-bearing
conventions:

- **Header row = `h-10` (40px), `border-b border-border-subtle`, `px-2`.** Every
  header reads at the same height: left wordmark, dock/rail header, files
  header, editor header. Use `border-border-subtle`, not `border-border`.
  **Exception — the two chrome strips**: the context tab strip
  (`ContextTabBar`, the band) and the dock header (`DockHeader`, transparent
  on the dock's own chrome) are the same `h-10` with tonal separation and
  **no bottom border** (see the three-tone invariant above, and the tab-chip
  grammar in `globals.css`). Do not reintroduce a rule under either strip.
- **One collapse/expand control: `shell/PanelToggleButton.tsx` (`size-8`),
  inset `px-2`.** This is the canonical toggle column. **Invariant — "click
  without moving the mouse":** a surface's collapse button and the matching
  expand control that appears after it collapses MUST sit at the same screen-x.
  That only holds if every surface uses the *same* `px-2` inset; mixing insets
  breaks it. (This `px-2` deliberately supersedes the earlier `px-1` alignment
  from commit `30fa8a0`; `px-2` matches the LeftSidebar/PaneHeader reference.)
- **Status color via tokens** — `text-status-streaming`, `text-destructive` —
  never raw `emerald-*` / `rose-*`.

The repeating chrome is extracted only where it actually repeats
(`PaneHeader`, `RailPaneHeader`, `PanelToggleButton`) — not as
a god "RailShell" wrapper, because the chat dock is a `motion.div`, not a
`ResizablePanel`, and cannot be wrapped in a panel-baking shell.

## Surfaces & preferences

Stable surface ids (`layout/types.ts`): `threads`, `chat`, `context-viewer`,
`context-rail`.

`layout/surface-prefs-store.ts` is the **device-local** chrome-prefs store
(Zustand `persist`, localStorage key `meridian:project-surface-layout`,
`version: 3`). It stores width + collapsed per surface, plus the
shared `slotPrefs.dock`. **Slot placement is NOT stored** — it is a pure function
of the active screen, merged into a render-time `SurfaceLayoutMap` by the
placement module. `DEFAULT_*`/`*_WIDTH_BOUNDS` are the clamps.

Browser-storage keys use `meridian:` + kebab-case. Scope per-project/per-work/per-file
state inside the persisted value, not by appending entity ids to the key.

## Reload stability — the hydration gate (load-bearing)

The shell previously hit an intermittent **"Maximum update depth exceeded"** loop
on reload. Root cause: non-atomic prefs hydration racing with a redundant
whole-prefs subscription and a double-firing tab effect. The fix is structural
and must not be regressed:

1. The prefs store persists with **`skipHydration: true`**.
2. `routes/_authenticated.tsx` calls `useProjectSurfacePrefsStore.persist
   .rehydrate()` (synchronous — localStorage) then `setHydrated()` immediately.
3. **`ProjectView` gates the whole `DesktopProject` mount on `_hydrated`** so it
   mounts exactly once against final persisted prefs (at most one frame, no
   visible flash).

Two rules keep this stable:

- **Gate at the parent (`ProjectView`), never inside `DesktopProject`.** A
  conditional `return null` placed *between* hook calls is a Rules-of-Hooks
  violation ("Rendered more hooks than during the previous render"). Hoist the
  gate above the component that runs the hooks.
- **`DesktopProject` takes a single merged layout subscription**
  (`useProjectLayout`). Do not add a second whole-prefs subscription — that
  redundant subscription was part of the original cascade.

Related: the project removal coordinator publishes a revisioned auto-open block.
`ContextPaneController` consumes that external-store snapshot, so a removal blocks
same-render and delayed cached-tree resurrection. A registered route host stays
live while the writer visits another project screen; only host release or Work
readiness suspension disables activation. Writer close and Work pruning are
reversible, while acknowledged deletion and draft discard keep exact re-entry
guards against stale resurrection.

## Screen routing & controllers

`routes/_authenticated/project/$projectId.tsx` owns **all** workspace URL params
(`?screen=`, `?thread=`, `?work=`, `?scheme=`, `?folder=`, `?path=`, `?results=`) and is the
single source of screen/thread ownership. The per-screen controllers
(`HomePaneController`, `WorkPaneController`, `ChatPaneController`,
`ContextPaneController`, `SettingsPaneController`) are **controlled** — they
render into surfaces and call
the route's handlers; they never set the URL directly. (Full ownership rules:
[`apps/app/.context/CONTEXT.md` § Project workspace screen routing](../../../../.context/CONTEXT.md).)

`routing/project-route.ts` is the pure route grammar: it preserves absent,
malformed, noncanonical, and canonical explicit Work inputs; resolves valid IDs
only against a successful all-status catalog; owns the search transition matrix;
and publishes awaitable typed commands. The route component remains the only
TanStack Router adapter. Collection/detail leaves receive targets and commands
rather than parsing or mutating search themselves.

A genuinely cold cross-project loader replaces the old project shell immediately
with the route's inert pending surface. It must not leave the previous project's
Context publishers mounted while the next project's Work authority is unresolved.
This is a route-lifetime boundary, not a query-refresh policy: once Work data has
successfully seeded the mounted project, a background `isFetching` refresh keeps
that project's Context host and mutation publishers live.

The **Editor** destination retains `ContextPaneController` as its implementation
name. It owns route-validated opens, temporary-tab projection, scroll restoration,
and screen-entry defaults. The platform-neutral project adapter owns revision
startup and dispatches Work pruning only after Work authority is ready. Project-entry
desk seed/validation is hydration-scoped and never re-runs on a Work change. The
removal coordinator owns close fallback, atomic old/new Work continuity,
remembered destination, and route repair:
entering with no destination replays the remembered last file
(`client/working-set/`; replay re-arms every entry because the controller is
persistent). Replay and the default-open ladder also re-arm when Editor Work
changes; remembered Scratch and Uploads routes are eligible only for their
owning Work, while project-scoped routes remain eligible everywhere. A known active route is projected as a loading tab and document
surface until the context tree validates and materializes its durable tab; a
resolved missing route drops that projection and returns to the empty state.
A desk with nothing to restore and no tabs runs the
default-open ladder. Clearing the desk clears its remembered routes without
changing the current entry; on the next entry, the default-open ladder runs.
This cleared state is intentionally ephemeral and has the same behavior on
every device.
`ContextViewer` and `ContextTabBar` are controlled views. The tab strip also owns the collapsed
sidebar/dock expand controls; Editor therefore supplies no separate route pane
or header band.

Chat switching lives in `features/chat/ThreadSwitcherPopover`: it filters by
chat title, groups chats by Work when grouping is meaningful, shows recency and
attention, and supports keyboard switching. Rename is available on the active
row; new chat remains a footer action. The route owner performs the actual
thread switch. `ProjectView` calls `chat/useResolvedChatThread` once, derives
the thread's Work, and passes that pair to context hydration, Draft Review, the
chat body, and every header that names the thread. Descendants must never
independently derive either id or their context, title, and conversation can
diverge.

## Don't

- Don't hardcode a surface background — let the slot paint the material.
- Don't introduce a second toggle inset value — `px-2` is the column.
- Don't reparent/unmount stateful surfaces on screen change — move the grid-area.
- Don't gate a mount between hook calls — gate at the parent.
- Don't add raw hex/rgba or `emerald`/`rose` — use semantic tokens.
