/**
 * What image ingress shows that is not a picture in the document.
 *
 * Two things only, and both are about events rather than content: a drag in the
 * air, and a refusal. Everything else a picture does while it arrives happens
 * in its own node, in its own slot, where the writer is looking.
 *
 * There is deliberately no upload status here. A progress report beside the
 * manuscript was the old shape, and it could only ever describe one upload
 * while promising the writer nothing about where the picture would land.
 *
 * A chrome surface like every other one: it arrives through
 * `EDITOR_CHROME_SURFACES` with the editor and nothing else, and reads the drag
 * state and the writer's editability off it. It is portalled INTO the scroll
 * pane rather than rendered beside it, because both things it draws are measured
 * against the manuscript's own box: a dashed drop zone inset from the pane, and
 * a pill at the top of the pane. Mounted at the shell instead, each would reach
 * over the toolbar.
