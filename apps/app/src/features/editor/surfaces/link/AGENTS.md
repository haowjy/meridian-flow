# surfaces/link — everything a writer meets a link through

The destination hint, the right-click menu, the form, the `[[` menu, what a
follow says when it finds nothing, and the runtime that gives an internal link
somewhere to go. Three entries in `EDITOR_CHROME_SURFACES` plus one headless
runtime `EditorView` mounts; policy and state live in
[`core/editor/links/`](../../../../core/editor/links/AGENTS.md),
[`core/editor/extensions/wikilink/`](../../../../core/editor/extensions/wikilink/AGENTS.md),
and — for the rows and their ranking, which the chat composer will share —
[`core/completion/`](../../../../core/completion/AGENTS.md).

## Mental model

Three summoned components, three physics, one store.

- **`LinkHint`** — approach chrome (law 7). It takes no focus, claims no layer,
  and lets the pointer through; it fades both ways, because the store nulls the
  hint on the kernel's leave grace and unmounting on that frame reads as a
  blink.
- **`LinkMenu`** — the primary link surface (§5.5, ruled). The kernel's claim
  ladder already decided it wins the right-click; this owns the verbs, and
  every one acts on the range the pointer hit rather than on the caret.
- **`LinkForm`** — one surface behind three doors: Ctrl+K, the toolbar's Link
  button, and the menu's Edit link. It hangs at the caret, because the writer
  is looking at their own sentence.

Beside them, three things that are not summoned surfaces:

- **`WikilinkMenu`** — rows for the `[[` trigger, over the shared
  `SuggestionMenu` the slash menu also renders through. Its documents come from
  the context trees the app already caches (`useLinkableDocuments`), so opening
  it costs no request: the manuscript and the active Work's scratch. This legacy
  suggestion projection is narrower than the server resolver, which searches
  Project content, authenticated personal content, and the selected Work or
  no-Work scope through the canonical Context catalog. The local index still
  carries each offered document's id and URI, which is where a relative link's
  base comes from, and its own revision, which tells a cached answer that the
  project moved underneath it.
- **`FollowOutcomeDialog`** — what a follow says when the document is not there.
  A chrome surface rather than the runtime's own dialog, and that is the whole
  point: it can open a quarter second after the click, so the kernel has to know
  it is the open transient.
- **`ProjectLinkRuntime`** — the app's half of the link system, mounted by
  `EditorView` and rendering nothing. It registers the resolution port every
  internal link is drawn from and the navigator a follow is handed to, and it
  reports what a follow found into the store the dialog reads. It also owns the
  resolution scope, which is the one thing here that is not a surface concern.

## Key rules

- **Absent, not greyed** (law 5). Open link is missing when nothing can follow
  the target, which is the honest state for an internal link before the app
  registers a navigator. A verb that cannot work does not appear. Copy link
  address is the exception, and for the reason the clipboard rows below it grey:
  a withheld clipboard is the browser's answer rather than the link's, it can
  arrive while the menu is open, and the writer who pressed Copy has to hear
  that nothing was copied. So that press keeps the menu open until the write
  settles.
- **The form has no preconditions.** A selection, a bare caret, a caret inside
  a link, a read-only-turned document mid-edit: each has an answer. It refuses
  nothing silently.
- **The menu acts by position.** Writers right-click a link paragraphs away
  from the caret constantly; a verb that quietly edited the caret's link
  instead would be the worst kind of correct. The clipboard rows are the one
  exception, and only where the writer made it one: a passage they had already
  swept around the link is what they chose, so Cut takes that.
- **Copy comes from the link core.** A component that spells out what a target
  means, or decides whether it can be followed, is a second classifier.
- **Unresolved is a sentence, never a warning.** The hint says no document
  carries that name yet and the follow offers to write the page; neither is
  an error voice, because linking ahead of writing is the job (§5.5).
- **A pending answer claims nothing.** The hint shows the destination and
  waits, and a follow only interrupts after 250ms — long enough that a link
  already resolved for rendering just opens.
- **An answer belongs to a scope, not to a href.** `{ projectId, workId,
  baseUri, revision }` is the whole semantic input to a resolution — the last
  being which documents the project holds — so the resolver is registered per
  scope and re-registered when any of them changes; registering forgets every
  answer and every failure the last scope produced. A Work switch never remounts
  the editor, a base URI arriving is a scope change (which re-asks the relative
  links that had nothing to be relative to yet), and a rename is one too: the
  link is spelled the same and its answer is now the wrong document.
- **No component invalidates the link cache.** A create or a rename anywhere in
  the app is a new document catalog, and the catalog is what the resolution
  scope is keyed on. A mutation button that also pokes the resolution store is
  a second owner of the same rule.
- **A failed request is not an unresolved link.** It renders as an ordinary
  link and says so on follow, with Try again. Drawing it dashed would tell the
  writer their document is missing when the truth is that nobody asked.

## Anti-patterns

- A local `setTimeout` for hover timing. The kernel owns it and cancels it on
  a gesture; a local timer lingers through a drag.
- Mirroring the store in `useState`. One `useSyncExternalStore` reading is what
  keeps the three from disagreeing.
- A second copy of the clipboard block. Cut, Copy, and Paste are one block two
  menus mount (`../formatting/clipboard-menu.tsx`); this menu supplies only the
  subject the verbs act on and the way it closes once one has run.
- A `navigator.clipboard` reading of this lane's own. Capability and what a
  refusal was belong to `features/editor/clipboard.ts`; the menu chooses the
  payload (the href) and where the answer goes (the row).
