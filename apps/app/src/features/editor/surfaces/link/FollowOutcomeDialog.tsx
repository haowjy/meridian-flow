/**
 * What a follow says when the document it named is not there.
 *
 * A follow that finds nothing is the interesting case. Serial writers link
 * chapters before they write them, so the honest answer is an offer to write the
 * page now rather than an error: mockup 06 state A, and §5.5's "opening one
 * offers to create the document and link it". Nothing about the link changes when
 * the document appears — `[[Warden Ilsever]]` was always the link, and the
 * resolver simply starts finding it.
 *
 * A chrome surface like any other, and that part is load-bearing: this dialog can
 * arrive a quarter second after the click, by which time the writer may have
 * summoned the slash menu or the link form. Registering as a layer is what makes
 * the kernel replace that surface instead of leaving two of them claiming Escape
 * (law 4). `ProjectLinkRuntime` answers the follow; this only reads the answer.
