/**
 * The destination hint: what this link goes to, shown on approach.
 *
 * Ruled with the click (ruling 4): a click follows the link, so hover has to
 * say where before it does. Approach chrome, not a surface (law 7) — it takes
 * no focus, claims no layer, and never blocks the words under it, so it hangs
 * below the link's left edge and lets pointer events pass through.
 *
 * It fades rather than vanishing. The store nulls the hint after the kernel's
 * leave grace, and unmounting on that frame would read as a blink, so the last
 * link stays rendered at zero opacity for the fade duration.
 *
 * Drawn in the manuscript pane's coordinates (`chrome/manuscript-overlay.ts`),
 * so it travels with its link through a scroll and is clipped by the pane
 * rather than riding up over the app above it.
 *
 * An internal link says two things: where it goes, and — when nothing is there
 * yet — that nothing is there yet. The second line is a sentence rather than a
 * warning, because linking a chapter before writing it is how serial writers
 * work (§5.5). While the answer is still in flight it says only the
 * destination: a hint that guessed "not written" and corrected itself a moment
 * later would be worse than one that waited.
