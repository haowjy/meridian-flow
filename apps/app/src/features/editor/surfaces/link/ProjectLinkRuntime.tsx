/**
 * The app's half of the link system: where an internal link actually goes.
 *
 * The editor core knows a link is internal and nothing else; the project, the
 * Work, the router, and the tab strip are the app's. This is that seam and only
 * that seam — it registers the resolution port the manuscript's links are drawn
 * from and the navigator a follow is handed to, and it renders nothing.
 * Registering the navigator is also what makes the link menu's Open link verb
 * appear at all: absent until something can follow, never dead (law 5).
 *
 * What a follow FOUND is reported into the link store, and the surface that says
 * it out loud mounts through the chrome host
 * ([`FollowOutcomeDialog`](FollowOutcomeDialog.tsx)). A dialog opened from here
 * would be a transient surface the kernel never heard about — and this one can
 * open a quarter second late, long after the writer summoned something else.
 *
 * **An answer belongs to a scope, not to a href.** What `[[Notes]]` or
 * `./cast.md` points at is a function of the project, the active Work, the URI
 * of the document holding the link, and which documents the project holds; all
 * four are this component's own inputs, the last as the document index's
 * revision. So the resolver is registered per scope and re-registered when any
 * of them changes, and `registerResolver` drops every answer and every failure
 * the previous scope produced before the next question is asked. That keeps Work
 * a runtime scope — nothing here remounts the collaborative editor — while
 * making a stale answer unreachable rather than merely unlikely.
 *
 * A rename is the case that makes the catalog part load-bearing: `[[Old Name]]`
 * is spelled the same before and after, and the answer it already has is now a
 * door onto the wrong document. One lifecycle owns all four, so no mutation
 * anywhere in the app needs a line that pokes this cache.
