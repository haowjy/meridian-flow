/**
 * The link's context menu — the primary link surface (§5.5, ruled).
 *
 * Every right-click in the editor opens an editor menu and the deepest context
 * wins, so a link takes the claim from the selection or the caret it sits in
 * (`core/editor/chrome/context-claims.ts` is the table; Shift+right-click is
 * the writer's way back to the browser's own menu). The claim already happened
 * in the kernel's ladder by the time this renders; what it owns is the verbs.
 *
 * Every verb here acts on the range the pointer hit, never on the selection.
 * A writer right-clicks a link three paragraphs from the caret constantly, and
 * a menu that quietly edited the caret's link instead would be the worst kind
 * of correct.
 *
 * The clipboard block at the bottom is the formatting menu's, mounted rather
 * than copied: mockup 06 state C ends with Cut, Copy, and Paste, and a writer
 * must meet the same three rows, the same wording, and the same reason for a
 * refusal in whichever menu they opened.
 *
 * Open link is absent, not greyed, when nothing can follow the target (law 5:
 * absent beats disabled). That is the honest state for an internal link while
 * no navigator is registered, and for an href the classifier does not
 * recognize.
 *
 * Copy link address is the one verb here that greys instead of vanishing, and
 * for the reason the Cut/Copy/Paste rows below grey: a withheld clipboard is
 * the browser's answer rather than the link's, it can arrive while the menu is
 * open, and a writer who pressed Copy has to hear that nothing was copied.
