/**
 * Where the handle and the drop line go, measured on a frame rather than in
 * render.
 *
 * Both readings are `getBoundingClientRect` and `getComputedStyle` against a
 * DOM ProseMirror has only just rewritten, and the surface re-renders on every
 * transaction — the writer's own keystrokes, a peer typing, an AI write
 * landing. Measuring them in render forced a synchronous layout on each one.
 * A frame coalesces the burst, and the state only moves when the numbers did,
 * so a transaction that changed nothing on screen costs one measurement and no
 * render at all.
 *
 * A scroll is no longer one of the things that moves these numbers: they are in
 * the manuscript overlay's coordinates, and the pane carries the handle and the
 * line through a scroll itself (`features/editor/chrome/manuscript-overlay.ts`).
 *
 * WHICH signals mean "measure again" is not this lane's question. A block
 * travels for reasons a `ResizeObserver` on one element never sees — three
 * paragraphs inserted above, the pane scrolling under a hand that never moved,
 * a diagram finishing its render — and every floating surface in the editor
 * needs the same list, so they share one: `watchManuscriptLayout`.
 *
 * Its own module because it changes for its own reasons: geometry and frame
 * timing, not pointer capture and not what a menu row says.
