/**
 * What a block move operates on, and every transaction that moves one.
 *
 * The movable unit is a TOP-LEVEL block: a direct child of the document. That
 * single choice is what makes the drop seams safe by construction — a seam
 * between two top-level children can never land inside a table, a figure, a
 * code fence, or a list item, so "never drop inside a protected node" is a
 * property of the geometry rather than a check somebody has to remember. The
 * handle in the margin points at the same unit, so the writer's target and the
 * drop target are one thing.
 *
 * Nested reordering (a list item among its siblings, a row inside a table) is
 * deliberately not here: rows belong to the table surface (§4, deepest owner)
 * and list items have no design yet. See `.context/FUTURE`.
 *
 * Pure over `EditorState` — every function returns a `Transaction` or a
 * reading, never dispatches. The surface beside it does the dispatching, so
 * the move itself is testable without a view.
