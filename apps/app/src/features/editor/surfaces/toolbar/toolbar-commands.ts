/**
 * The document toolbar's command layer: what each control can do in the

 *
 * Two jobs live here because they share one set of refusal predicates, and the
 * sharing is the point — a control may never advertise what dispatch will
 * refuse:
 *
 * - `documentToolbarControls` derives the enablement matrix the toolbar
 *   renders. A control that cannot apply reports WHY, so the surface can grey
 *   it with a reason instead of letting a press silently no-op (law 5). The
 *   matrix never removes a control: the toolbar's geometry is fixed
 *   (ruling 15).
 * - the exported commands re-check the same predicates before touching the
 *   document. The greyed button is the first fence; this is the second, and
 *   for the block-type commands it is load-bearing — a selected figure, a
 *   mermaid fence, or a registered component must never convert into a
 *   heading, however the command is reached (interaction model §7, F6).
 *
 * The two families fence differently on purpose. A block-type conversion
 * rewrites whole blocks, so it refuses a selection where ANY target is
 * protected. A mark lands only on the inline content that accepts it, so it
 * refuses only when NO target can take it.

 * Walks `selection.ranges` rather than `from`..`to`: a `CellSelection` reports
 * only its FIRST cell as that pair, while ProseMirror's own commands run over
 * every range — so a fence sitting in the fourth cell would be advertised as
 * convertible and then refused by dispatch, which is the dead control law 5
 * forbids.
 *
 * Each block is read at its own first inside position, so the resolver answers
 * about the block rather than about its neighbours. A selection is not a
 * context; asking per block is what tells a select-all across a fence from a
 * caret inside one.
