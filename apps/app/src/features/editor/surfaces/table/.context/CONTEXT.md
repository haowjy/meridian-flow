# Table chrome — contracts and the calls behind them

Reference depth for the table surface. Read [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) first.

## The verb matrix

`tableVerbStates(state, { editable })` maps the selection to one
`{ active, blockedBy }` per verb. Reasons are codes; `table-copy.ts` turns them
into writer copy, so the same code can read differently per verb.

| Context | Blocked verbs | Reason code |
|---|---|---|
| Selection outside any table | all | `no-table` |
| Read-only host or schema fence | all | `document-read-only` |
| Selection is on the header row | insert row above, move row up, move row down | `header-row-first` |
| First or last row/column in the move's direction | that move | `at-table-edge` |
| Any merged cell anywhere in the table | all four moves | `merged-cells` |
| One row left | delete row | `single-row` |
| One column left | delete column | `single-column` |
| A caret rather than a cell selection | merge cells | `one-cell-selected` |
| Cell selection that is not a rectangle | merge cells | `cells-not-rectangular` |
| Selection spans the header row and the body | merge cells | `header-and-body` |
| More than one cell selected | split cell | `many-cells-selected` |
| One cell selected, carrying no span | split cell | `not-merged` |
| No cell carries a `colwidth` | reset column widths | `no-column-widths` |

Read-only outranks every structural reason: on a document the writer cannot
change, saying so once is the honest answer.

Inserts, deletes, alignment, the header toggle, and placement are never blocked
by a span — only the four moves are, because reordering rows or columns by
index across a merged cell corrupts the grid. `active` is computed for the
reflecting verbs (alignment, header, placement) even where something is
blocked: what is on can always come off.

**Alignment reports unset as unset.** A column nobody has aligned reads in the
reading direction and has not been decided, which is different from a column
decided to be left. The radio group shows no choice made; `null` is a value.

## Geometry

`tableChromePieces` is the whole placement decision: a pure function of three
rectangles — the table, the hovered column band, the hovered row band —
returning a box per piece. All three arrive in the manuscript pane's
coordinates and so does every answer, which is what makes a grip a label on its
row rather than a thing that chases it: the pane carries the chrome through a
scroll and these numbers never change. Sizes live there too, not in CSS: the
module that decides where a grip goes has to know how big it is.

| Piece | Placement |
|---|---|
| Column grip | 30×15 pill, centred on the hovered column, bottom edge 4px above the table |
| Row grip | 15×30 pill, centred on the hovered row, right edge 6px left of the table |
| Add column tab | 18px circle, 9px right of the table's right edge, vertically centred |
| Add row tab | 18px circle, 6px INSIDE the table's bottom edge, horizontally centred |

**The add-row tab is inside the frame, and mockup 05 draws it below.** The
constraint won (human ruling, 2026-07-29: chrome never overlaps prose, and a
click aimed at prose must never mutate a table). All that separates two blocks
is `.ProseMirror > * + *` at `0.9em` — 14.4px at the reading size, less at a
smaller one — and the tab is 18px, so no gap below the frame keeps it out of
the paragraph under the table. At 9px it ran to y=1092.6 while that paragraph's
first line box began at 1083, and a click on the writer's own first line added
a row. Sideways nothing collides: a table is a block, so the space beside it is
the page gutter or the table's own empty half, and the add-column tab keeps its
gap.

`tableHoverZone` is the other half of the same decision: the frame expanded by
each side's band (19 top, 21 left, 27 right, 15 bottom), which is what the
pointer has to stay inside for a reveal to hold. The bottom band is half a row
grip, because nothing is placed below the frame any more and the only thing
that still reaches there is a grip centred on a last row shorter than itself.
Placement and hover are checked against each other in the tests — a piece drawn
outside the zone would dismiss itself as the writer reached for it.

**The pane clips; nothing here does.** The chrome is drawn IN the manuscript's
scroll pane, so its overflow takes off whatever has left it, exactly and on the
frame it leaves — a grip whose row is halfway off the top slides under the edge
with the row. Nothing is clamped either: a grip pushed back inside would sit
beside a row it does not serve. The document toolbar needs no special case; it
lives above the pane rather than inside it, so nothing drawn in the pane can
reach it.

This replaced a per-piece fit test against a viewport rect, which was wrong
twice over: it was all-or-nothing where the clip is exact, and it was computed
from a measurement a frame behind the scroll that invalidated it. Probed at one
wheel notch a frame, that frame drew the row grip beside a row three below the
one the pointer was on, and the block handle — which had no fit test at all —
over the app's breadcrumb.

When the hovered cell itself leaves the visible part of the pane — scrolled
away, or taken by a peer deleting the row — the anchor is released whole: open
menu closed, anchor dropped. `overlayViewport` is what answers that, and it is
the one question the pane's clip cannot: a grip half off the edge is still the
right grip, while a row nobody can see has nothing left for a menu to aim at.
Closing the menu is the load-bearing part. An open menu holds the anchor still
so a stray hover cannot move the grips out from under it, so a menu that
outlived its own row would pin the surface to a cell nobody is on and no later
hover could replace it: the table's chrome never came back.

The coordinator is handed a `NodeHold` as this lane's reading
(`registerHoverAnchor<NodeHold>`), because it keeps that reading until the
pointer moves again and re-delivers it after any layout change. A position kept
there is a position cached across a peer's write: with a grip menu open, a peer
`addRowBefore` above the writer's row made the re-delivered number name the new
empty cell, and the grips jumped to the peer's row the moment the menu closed
(measured in a two-browser CDP session, 2026-07-29). Resolving the hold answers
with the cell or with nothing.

What "the cell" means here is the hold, not the element. The approach settles on
a `NodeHold` and `useNodeHold` carries it through every transaction, so a rebuild
that replaces the `<td>` moves the grips and a rebuild that takes the cell away
releases them. `cellElementAt` is the crossing back to geometry and
`cellDocPosition` the crossing in from the pointer. Nothing between them is kept
as a number: an open menu freezes the grips on the cell it already holds, and
where the pointer is remains the kernel's to report at its next reading of the
page.

Opacity on the container fades all four together. The container is a zero-size
box pinned to the pane's content origin, and opacity makes a stacking context
but **not** a containing block, so each piece still resolves against the pane
and lands on exactly the coordinates it was measured in — do not add
`transform` or `will-change` to that container or every grip will jump.

Rects are re-measured on `watchManuscriptLayout`: a `ResizeObserver` over the
cell and the table, a resize, and every editor transaction, because a row grows
as the writer types into it. Scroll is in that list too and no longer changes
anything — the numbers are scroll-invariant now, which is the point.

## The four menus, and who takes a right-click

| Shape | Door | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| Row | row grip, left-click or right-click | insert, merge/split, move, delete, `Table ▸` |
| Column | column grip, either button | insert, alignment, merge/split, move, delete, `Table ▸` |
| Cells | right-click inside a swept rectangle | merge/split, alignment, `Table ▸` |
| Table | the selected table's ⋮ | header row, alignment, placement, widths, delete |

The cell menu is deliberately the shortest. Merge and split are what a
rectangle exists for, alignment applies to the columns it covers, and the row
and column verbs already have a home on the grips a few pixels away; a third
copy of them would be three places saying the same thing.

`cell-selection` is the ladder's last rung, added because nothing above it
wanted a `CellSelection`: `proseSelectionCovers` admits `TextSelection` and
`AllSelection` only, so the formatting menu stands down, a grip is chrome
rather than a cell, and `objectSurfaceKind` returns null for a table. A swept
rectangle therefore reached no menu at all. Last is the right place for it: a
link inside a selected cell is still a link, and a grip drawn over one is
still a grip.

`claimedSweptCells` decides it, pure and testable, and answers with the two
cells rather than with a yes: the claim is the last moment the rectangle is on
screen. It asks whether the pointer is inside one of the cells the selection
COVERS, not whether it falls in the selection's `from`..`to` range: a rectangle
two columns wide in a four-column table spans cells it does not contain.

## What a menu acts on

`TableMenuTarget` is the one answer, in three shapes:

| Shape | Held | Materialized as |
|---|---|---|
| `axis` | the cell a grip serves, and `row` or `column` | `CellSelection.rowSelection` / `colSelection` on that cell |
| `cells` | a swept rectangle's anchor and head cells | `CellSelection.create` between them |
| `selection` | nothing | the writer's own selection, as it stands |

`tableTargetState` materializes a target into the state the verb matrix is read
from — applied, never dispatched, because asking what a verb would do must not
move the writer's selection. `runTableVerbOn` dispatches that same selection and
then runs the verb. Both answer null once a held cell is gone, and null closes
the menu.

Neither the selection nor a position can be the target, and both were measured:

- A peer typing one character above the table restores the writer's place as a
  caret, so a swept rectangle stops being selected and `mergeCells` answers
  `one-cell-selected` while its menu is still open.
- A peer's `addRowBefore` leaves a different, EMPTY cell at the number the
  pointer last read, so a position that still starts a cell says nothing about
  which cell. Re-holding there moved the grips to the peer's new row and pointed
  "delete row" at it.

Both cases are in [`table-cell-hold.test.ts`](../table-cell-hold.test.ts),
against two real bindings, because only a second y-prosemirror binding produces
the whole-document rebuild that causes them.

`selection` holds nothing because those menus are mounted BY the arrangement
they act on — the caret's lists inside the formatting menu, the selected table's
⋮ — and they end by being unmounted rather than by outliving it.

## The left margin is shared, and the bands must not stack

Measured on the manuscript column: prose edge 288, table frame 328, so the
margin is a 40px band. Two controls live in it, and the split is a ruling:

| Band | Owner | x |
|---|---|---|
| outer | block handle | 284 to **306** |
| inner | row grips | **307** to 322 |

A grip belongs beside the row it serves; the block handle is a document-level
control, so it takes the outer band. This lane's half is
`table.left - ROW_GRIP_GAP - GRIP_SHORT`, which is 21px inside the frame at
any column width; M9's handle clears 22, one pixel outside it. `ROW_GRIP_GAP`
is the one number to change here if the ruling ever goes the other way, and
the grip cannot vacate inward much: it is 15px around a 13px icon. The hover
zone's left edge is the same 21: it has to reach the grip and must not reach
past it, or the band the handle is hovered in belongs to two surfaces again.

M9's [`blocks/.context/CONTEXT.md`](../../blocks/.context/CONTEXT.md) states
the same split from the other side; change one and the other is wrong.

## Hover and the menus

The approach is the kernel's, through one `registerHoverAnchor` lane
(`core/editor/chrome/hover-anchor.ts`). This lane answers one question — which
cell of this table is at this point — and gets back its share of whichever
block currently owns hover chrome. The reading it hands over is a `NodeHold`
(the cell's identity, not its element or position), so an unchanged cell
settles once rather than on every pointer move and a peer's inserted row
cannot leave the grips on the wrong cell.

**No pointer listener here.** The grips are portalled OUTSIDE the editor, so a
listener bound to the prose watches the pointer leave and never watches it
arrive. Pairing that with a React `onMouseEnter` on the portal put two
mechanisms in a 120ms race across a tree boundary, and the race is why a grip
stopped being clickable a moment after it appeared: the reveal faded,
`pointer-events: none` went on, and the right-click fell through to the
browser. The kernel's one reading of the page answers the same on both sides of
the portal, and it re-asks after a scroll the writer's hand did not follow.

**The zone, not the chrome's elements — and that part is still this lane's.**
Asking whether the pointer is over a grip leaves the pixels BETWEEN the frame
and the grip belonging to nobody, and the pointer crosses them on every
approach: measured, 4px above the frame and 6px left of it. That is the lane's
`holds` predicate (`pointerHoldsTableChrome`), the one thing about this reveal
the kernel cannot know. The kernel's own re-entry is what cancels the grace the
frame's edge scheduled — left running, it fades the grip out from under a
pointer already resting on it, after which the closed chrome takes no pointer
events and `elementFromPoint` over the grip answers the prose underneath.

**Nesting turns the gap into a competing hit, and that judgment is this
lane's too.** A table nested in another table's cell shares its top-level
hover owner with it, and the gap beside the inner frame sits on the OUTER
table's cell — so instead of the probe missing (which is what lets `holds`
vote), the lane freshly hits the outer cell and the reveal re-anchored to the
outer table before the pointer reached the inner grip. The lane's `reconcile`
hook arbitrates the held cell against the fresh one: the held cell wins while
the fresh cell's table `contains` the held cell's table and the pointer is
still inside the held table's `tableHoverZone` (`nestedCellKeepsReveal` in
[`table-anchors.ts`](../table-anchors.ts)). Ancestry is containment, never a
depth count, so a depth-3 hold outranks a depth-2 and a depth-1 hit alike;
any other fresh cell — same table, deeper table, sibling table — wins, which
is what keeps grips following the pointer cell to cell and moves the reveal
inward when the writer hovers the nested table itself.

While a menu is open the anchor is frozen: a stray hover would slide the grips
out from under the menu and leave it pointing at another row. The approach
keeps settling meanwhile and the lane remembers the answer, so on close the
pointer's real position is read back rather than the chrome lingering where the
writer left it.

**The selected table's ⋮ reads the kernel's context, not the document.** This
surface is mounted for the whole session, so a blunt per-transaction
subscription re-rendered it on every keystroke of the chapter to answer a
question that changes rarely. `useChromeContext` reports `owner: "object"` with
`nodeType: "table"` and the position, and the store only notifies when that
answer changes. The rects follow the document separately, and only while a cell
is anchored.

Each grip is its own Radix trigger, so nothing here uses the pointer anchor.
`GripButton` composes Radix's injected `onPointerDown` rather than replacing
it: the selection is armed first, then the library opens.

## Column resize: the plugin, not our own (verdict)

prosemirror-tables' `columnResizing` was already mounted by
`MeridianTable.configure({ resizable: true })`. It was kept. Evidence from the
browser:

- **Hover-only.** The handle is a widget decoration the plugin adds only while
  the pointer is within `handleWidth` (5px) of a boundary, and removes on the
  next `mousemove` away.
- **Zero layout shift**, after one fix. The widget is `position: absolute`
  inside the cell, so it takes no space — but it is a real DOM sibling, so the
  cell's paragraph stopped being the last child and its 8px bottom margin came
  back, growing every row in the column. `td > p:last-of-type` ignores the
  widget (it is a `div`), and the cell measures 41px with the hairline up and
  down.
- **Widths persist where the codec reads them.** A drag writes `colwidth: [n]`
  on every cell of the column via `setNodeMarkup`; `Layout`'s `widths` prop is
  serialized from the first row's `colwidth`. Measured: a 70px drag produced
  `[266]` on all six cells of the column and `<col style="width: 266px">`.

Owning resize would have bought nothing and cost a drag implementation, a drop
of the plugin's spanned-column arithmetic, and a second place widths are
written.

**A column is sized by its prose, and by a picture only through a fence.** The
grid is auto layout, which sizes columns from what is inside them — right for
text, and a trap for a picture, whose box carries a width in pixels that the
column would grow to before `max-width: 100%` had anything to resolve against.
A cell holding a picture therefore contains its own size and asks the table for
one definite 8rem instead, in `features/editor/editor.css`; the reasoning is
[`core/editor/images/.context/CONTEXT.md`](../../../../../core/editor/images/.context/CONTEXT.md).
The dragged widths above are unaffected: they are `colwidth` on the cells, which
the fence never touches.

## Merging block-capable cells

`mergeTableCells` is prosemirror-tables' `mergeCells` behind one fence:

- **The header row does not merge into the body** (`mergeCrossesHeader`).
  Upstream merges any rectangle and keeps the first cell's type, so a
  whole-column merge on a headed table yields one header cell spanning every
  row. The fence is in the command as well as the menu. Merging the header row
  across itself stays allowed: that is a title row.

Cells hold `block+`, so upstream's append of every filled cell's blocks into
the merged cell is schema-legal as it stands — lists, headings, and fences
land whole, in reading order. Upstream's emptiness test is structural (one
childless text block), so a cell holding only a hard break or an inline image
counts as filled and merges in rather than being skipped.

## What the wire carries now

**Spans** are on the wire (the codec escalates a spanned table to raw
HTML), and so are span-sized `colwidth` arrays — see the widths ruling in
[`packages/markup/.context/CONTEXT.md`](../../../../../../../../packages/markup/.context/CONTEXT.md).
Cells carrying several blocks, or blocks beyond a paragraph, travel the same
way: the codec escalates them too.

## Where the lane touched shared code

- `core/editor/table-operations.ts` — grid coordinates, header awareness,
  `toggleTableHeaderRow`, `mergeTableCells`, `setTablePlacement`,
  `resetTableColumnWidths`. `resetTableLayout` was deleted: it had no consumer
  and conflated placement with widths, which the menu offers separately.
- `core/editor/chrome/` — the Esc chain's fourth step (prose inside an object
  steps out onto the object) and `ChromeContext.objectPos` behind it.
- `features/editor/chrome/OverlayIconRow.tsx` — the overflow chip forwards its
  props, so it can actually be a menu trigger.
