/**
 * A grip serves a cell, and a menu serves the cells it was opened on, for as
 * long as the writer is reaching for them — and the table is being written into
 * by collaborators the whole time.
 *
 * Two bindings, because that is the only way to produce the change this has to
 * survive: y-prosemirror replaces the whole ProseMirror document on every remote
 * write, so the mapping reports every position deleted, the elements drawing the
 * table are reconciled underneath, and the writer's own selection comes back as
 * a caret. The hold answers which cell; the page answers where it is drawn; the
 * menu's target answers which cells its verbs run on.
