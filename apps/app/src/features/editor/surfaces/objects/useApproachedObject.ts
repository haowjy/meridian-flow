/**
 * Which object the writer is approaching, and whether its controls show.
 *
 * Law 7's "chrome on approach" has two doors into the same state: hover
 * reveals, and selection (or a caret inside a fence) makes it persistent. One
 * hook answers both, so the diagram row, the image row, and the code chips
 * cannot disagree about who is being approached.
 *
 * `target` and `visible` are separate on purpose, and the gap between them is
 * the fade: the anchor is held for the fade's duration after the writer leaves,
 * so the row fades out over its object rather than blinking away from under
 * the pointer.
 *
 * Both doors settle on a `NodeHold`, never on the element the pointer hit.
 * Elements are geometry: an element is how the pointer names an object and how
 * the row is measured, and a remote write replaces it while the writer is still
 * looking at the same diagram. So what this hook carries between frames is the
 * object, and DOM is resolved from it on every read.
