/**
 * Editing a fence through a textarea, without eating a collaborator's words.
 *
 * A `<textarea>` reports a whole string, not an edit. Diffing that string
 * against the *current* document is wrong the moment anyone else is typing:
 * text a peer added since the pane rendered was never in the writer's textarea,
 * so the diff reads it as a deletion and Yjs merges that faithfully. The
 * collaborator's line disappears, and nothing about the transaction says it was
 * an accident.
 *
 * So the diff runs against what the pane RENDERED — which is exactly what the
 * writer edited — and its offsets are mapped forward through every LOCAL
 * transaction that has landed since, ProseMirror's own answer to "where is
 * that text now". With nobody else typing the mapping is empty and this is one
 * `insertText`.
 *
 * A peer's write is the case the mapping cannot answer: it arrives as a
 * replacement of the whole document, so every offset maps to a boundary. The
 * document is re-read instead, and when the fence itself changed underneath
 * the writer the pane has no usable base at all until the next render supplies
 * one — refusing there is what keeps the diff from reading the peer's new line
 * as the writer's deletion.
 *
 * The rebase resets on every render that shows new document text, so the base
 * and the mapping can never disagree about which version they describe.
