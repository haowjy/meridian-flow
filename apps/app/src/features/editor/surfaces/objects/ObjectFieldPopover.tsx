/**
 * The small popover the object's own words are edited in (§5.6: "Alt text edits
 * in a small popover").
 *
 * One surface for every field a registration declares, rather than one popover
 * per verb: the ⋯ item the writer picked decides which field takes the caret, and
 * a figure editing its caption can reach its label without going back to the
 * menu. Which fields are here at all is `surfaceFields` on the object's row, so
 * the inline picture and the captioned figure share this surface.
 *
 * **It writes as the writer types.** These are attributes on a node every peer
 * can see, and a form with a Save button would hold a second copy of the truth
 * for as long as it stayed open — the failure the figure's old node-view form
 * had. Each keystroke is one attribute step, so undo takes an edit back and a
 * collaborator watches the caption arrive.
 *
 * It holds the object the way every surface in this lane does: a `NodeHold`
 * resolved per render, so a peer's write cannot leave the popover writing into a
 * node that has moved or gone.
