/**
 * Which object a surface is aimed at, and which elements draw it right now.

 * The kernel resolves document positions; turning a position into DOM — and a

 * node views' shape. Everything here is a reading over an `EditorView`; nothing
 * dispatches.
 *
 * **Elements are geometry, holds are identity.** A target is derived at the
 * moment it is needed and never stored: its elements belong to node views a
 * remote write replaces. What a surface stores between frames is a `NodeHold`,
 * and `objectSurfaceForHold` is how it gets back to the page.
