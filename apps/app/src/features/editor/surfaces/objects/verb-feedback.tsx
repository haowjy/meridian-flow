/**
 * What a verb says back.
 *
 * Copy and download reach outside the page — to a clipboard the browser can
 * refuse, to a canvas it can decide is tainted — so every one of them can fail
 * for a reason the writer had no way to predict. Law 5 forbids the silent
 * rejection that follows: a menu item that closes on a `SecurityError` and says
 * nothing has told the writer their diagram was copied.
 *
 * One answer, one place. Every door — a chip on the row, an item in a ⋯, an
 * item in the dialog — routes its promise through `run`, and the surface that
 * owns the verb renders the notice where the writer is already looking. The
 * failure keeps its reason: "the browser blocked the clipboard" and "this
 * browser cannot export this diagram" call for different next moves.
