/**
 * What a diagram or an image offers, in one place for its three doors: the row's
 * two chips, the row's ⋮, and the right-click menu.
 *
 * Every item here is a read of the object's registration
 * (`core/editor/objects/object-types.ts`) rather than a branch on its node type.
 * A diagram's verbs come from its provider row — the name its copy uses, the
 * source it can edit, the picture it exports — and an image's metadata verbs come
 * from the registration's `surfaceFields`, which is how ONE image surface serves
 * both the inline picture and the captioned figure.
