/**
 * The lightbox an object opens over the page (Q1, mockup 04).
 *
 * A popup, never a route and never a takeover: the chapter stays visible and
 * mounted behind the scrim, so the object's place in the document is seen
 * rather than stated, and X or Esc lands the writer back exactly where they
 * were reading.
 *
 * The viewer face is the dialog's whole job. Revision is not — writers revise
 * machine-authored diagrams through the normal chat (the ask-AI hook was ruled
 * out), so the only editing surface here is the demoted source escape hatch
 * behind ⋮, which opens the raw source beside the live preview.
 *
 * Which diagram language that source is written in is the provider's business,
 * never this file's: the row names itself in the verbs and brings the renderer
 * the preview uses (`core/editor/diagrams/diagram-providers.ts`).
