/**
 * L-B: the object controls surface.
 *
 * One component owns every verb a diagram, an image, or a code block offers in
 * the page, because all three answer the same question — what is the writer
 * approaching — and a second answer is how two surfaces end up on screen at
 * once. Hover reveals, selection makes persistent, and the ⋮ holds what the row
 * has no room for.
 *
 * Diagram and image rows are `OverlayIconRow`s. A code block gets the chip
 * cluster instead: same inside-corner physics, different shape,
 * because its language is a labeled control.
 *
 * **Nothing here names an object type.** Which objects this surface serves, what
 * their ⋮ offers, and which keys they answer are all reads of
 * `EDITOR_OBJECT_TYPES`: the surfaces are registered per registration id, the
 * verbs come from `object-menu-items.tsx`, and the fields a ⋮ can edit come from
 * the row's `surfaceFields`. A new object kind — a new diagram provider included
 * — reaches this file as data.
 *
 * Two of the claim ladder's rungs land here. `object` is a right-click on a
 * diagram or an image, which opens the ⋮ it already has. `caret` is a
 * right-click INSIDE a plain fence, which used to reach the browser and now
 * opens the fence's own verbs as one list.
 *
 * **Approach is not identity.** Hover decides what the row hangs off; a menu
 * decides what its items act on. They are usually the same object and must not
 * be the same state: a right-click claims an object before hover intent has
 * settled on it, so a menu reading hover state would run Delete on whatever the
 * pointer passed over last.
 *
 * **Elements are geometry, holds are identity.** Every surface here — two menus,
 * the field popover, and the lightbox — remembers a `NodeHold` and resolves it
 * to the current node and the current DOM on every render. The element a
 * right-click landed on is gone as soon as a peer writes, and the writer is
 * still looking at the same diagram.
