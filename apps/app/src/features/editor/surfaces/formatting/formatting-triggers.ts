/**
 * When the formatting menu opens, and where it hangs.
 *
 * Two doors lead to one open call (§5.1): a right-click the kernel's claim
 * ladder routes here, and the Menu key or Shift+F10. Touch has no third door of
 * its own — a long press IS a `contextmenu` on every browser that gives the
 * page one, so it arrives through the ladder like any other right-click, which
 * is the only way a link or an object under the finger can outrank this rung.
 * See `.context/CONTEXT.md` for the platforms that give no such event.
 *
 * The right-click arrives at one of two rungs, and they ask different
 * questions of the same menu:
 *
 * - `text-selection` — the writer swept prose and pointed inside it. The menu
 *   acts on that sweep.
 * - `caret` — the ladder's floor. Every right-click in prose that no rung
 *   above wanted lands here, and the caret moves to
 *   where the writer pointed so the verbs act on the block they aimed at.
 *
 * The keyboard twin asks the first question only: Shift+F10 has no pointer, so
 * there is nowhere to move a caret TO, and a menu over the caret the writer is
 * already sitting in is what the key already means.
