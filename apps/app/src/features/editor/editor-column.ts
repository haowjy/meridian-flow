/**
 * The editor's prose column — ONE geometry, owned here.
 *
 * Every editor surface (tracked and temp) shares a centered 48rem column.
 * The document toolbar row starts exactly where the prose starts, so nothing
 * shifts when switching tabs or when a host mounts the editor without it.
 *
 * The horizontal inset is split across two layers — a wrapper and the
 * ProseMirror node's own padding. The whole editor pane is click-to-focus
 * territory (EditorSurfaceFrame routes gutter presses to the caret), so the
 * split is pure geometry now; the sum invariant these recipes encode is:
 *
 *   chrome inset  =  canvas wrapper inset  +  prose inset
 *   px-12/14/16   =  px-2/4/6              +  px-10
 *
 * That sum is also the GUTTER, and the gutter is load-bearing: the block
 * handle and the table's row grips are drawn in the manuscript's own scroll
 * pane, which clips them at its edge, so anything they reach past the text
 * edge has to fit inside it. `MARGIN_GUTTER_MIN` is what they reach
 * (`surfaces/blocks/block-geometry.ts`); every breakpoint here clears it, and
 * `editor-column.test.ts` fails if one stops.
 *
 * The ramp is in the wrapper alone — 48/56/64 — and the prose keeps one
 * padding at every width. It follows the viewport; a pane narrower than `@md`
 * (the dock's document) falls back to the 48 that still clears the gutter,
 * whatever the viewport, because its width is not the viewport's. A narrow window gives up 16px of line length for a
 * usable margin, which is the trade, and the reward is that crossing 768px no
 * longer moves the text edge by 24px per side.
 *
 * Change any inset only by editing this file; never re-encode these classes
 * at a call site.
