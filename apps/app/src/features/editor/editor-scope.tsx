/**
 * The scope one editor is open in: which project, and which Work.
 *
 * Project and Work are the writer's two primitives, and a manuscript is only
 * half the answer to "what can this document reach". The `@` menu offers the
 * manuscript AND the Work's scratch, the resolver is asked with a Work so
 * `work://notes.md` has a fallback to fall back to, and a door that opens a
 * document has to know which Work's scratch to look in. One value carries all
 * three answers so a second one never has to be threaded later.
 *
 * A provider rather than props on the host: `EditorChromeHost` hands a surface
 * the editor and nothing else, deliberately (no growing prop list, no lane
 * editing a shared file). Scope is the app's answer to that seam — a typed
 * value read where it is needed, which is what lets a surface that needs the
 * project mount through the host like every other one instead of beside it.
 *
 * It is NOT part of `EditorMountIdentity`: a Work changing is runtime scope, not
 * a reason to destroy a collaborative editor and its UndoManager.
