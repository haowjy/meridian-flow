/**
 * Putting an open surface in the Esc chain, and telling the chain where it
 * sits.
 *
 * Depth is the hard part. React mounts child effects before parent effects, so
 * a dialog that opens with its source pane already open registers the pane
 * first — and the design mandates exactly that (a new empty diagram opens with
 * its starter source showing). A chain that read registrations as a stack
 * would call the dialog topmost and close both on one Escape. So a layer says
 * who it is inside, through context, and the kernel orders by nesting rather
 * than by arrival.
 *
 * A surface that can contain another layer therefore has to wrap what it
 * renders in `layer.scope(...)`. The three wrappers in this directory already
 * do; a lane that hand-rolls a portal owes the same call.
 *
 * A layer is also where its keys belong. `keys` registers them with the kernel
 * for as long as the surface is open, at `layer` scope, with the reach that
 * survives focus sitting inside portalled content, and naming the layer that
 * owns them — so a dialog's shortcut is in the kernel's bindings, runs its
 * scope ladder, loses to the pane the dialog opened, and collides through the
 * same validation as every other lane's. A `document` listener in a surface has
 * none of that.
