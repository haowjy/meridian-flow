/**
 * SuggestionMenu — the list a writer types underneath, for `/` and for `[[`.
 *
 * The writer never leaves the sentence: focus stays in the prose, the query
 * they are typing IS the document text after the trigger, and this surface
 * only shows what the trigger has already matched. That is why nothing here is
 * focusable and why every row cancels its own mousedown — a menu that took
 * focus would stop the next keystroke from filtering.
 *
 * The keyboard is not here either. Arrow keys and Enter are registered against
 * the chrome kernel by whichever trigger opened the menu, at scope `layer`,
 * from the moment it opens; this component follows the highlight with the
 * scroll and renders it. Esc is the kernel's chain, reached by being an open
 * layer.
 *
 * A lane brings rows and reacts to a choice. Everything below — the eight-row
 * cap, the internal scroll, the fades on the list's own edges, the
 * announcement the caret's own element has to carry — is one behavior both
 * menus share, so neither lane can drift from the other on a Radix upgrade
 * (§5.7's height ruling).
 *
 * A row a lane cannot take is shown greyed rather than hidden, with the reason
 * in `note` (law 5: absent beats disabled, disabled beats dead, and a writer
 * who cannot see why an entry refuses is left to wonder). It keeps the hover
 * and focus path — `aria-disabled`, never the `disabled` attribute — because
 * that is the path the reason travels.
