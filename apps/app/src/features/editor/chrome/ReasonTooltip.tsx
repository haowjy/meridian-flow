/**
 * The tooltip a greyed control answers with.
 *
 * Law 5 says grey must say why; the ruling of 2026-07-29 says it says so on
 * demand. A reason printed under every refused row is standing information the
 * writer never asked for — three of them turn a menu into a paragraph — so the
 * control keeps its label alone and the reason waits for hover or focus. Every
 * greyed surface in the editor answers in this one shape: the control's name
 * when it has no visible one, then the reason beneath it.
 *
 * A `TooltipProvider` has to be somewhere above this; menus get one from
 * `EditorMenu`, the toolbar from `DocumentToolbar`.
