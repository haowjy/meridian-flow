/**
 * The menu row every editor surface renders, and the one place a refusal is
 * drawn.
 *
 * A row that cannot run here greys, keeps its hover and focus, drops its
 * action, and shows its LABEL ALONE; the reason arrives in a tooltip when the
 * writer reaches the row (law 5). Radix's `disabled` would
 * take the row out of the hover and focus path and the reason with it, so
 * nothing here uses it — `aria-disabled` says the same thing to a screen
 * reader and leaves the row reachable.
 *
 * Passing `blockedReason` is the whole contract: a lane never wires the
 * greying, the swallowed select, or the tooltip itself.
