/**
 * The pill the editor says short-lived things in.
 *
 * One shape for every transient status a surface has to report: a verb that
 * reached the clipboard, an export the browser refused, a picture it would not
 * take. Two tones, because "done" and "failed" are the only two answers a
 * writer needs from something that will be gone in a moment; a failure keeps
 * its reason, which is what law 5 asks of a refusal.
 *
 * Presentation only, and deliberately placeless: it blocks nothing, moves no
 * line of the manuscript, and knows nothing about where it hangs. WHERE a
 * notice appears belongs to the surface that raised it — over the object's own
 * corner, at the top of the scroll pane, inside a dialog — and how long it
 * stays belongs to whatever owns the notice.
