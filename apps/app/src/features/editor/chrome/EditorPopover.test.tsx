 * decoration leaves the DOM the moment the trigger text does, and a peer's
 * write rebuilds the manuscript between two paints. Answering it with a zero
 * `DOMRect` mounted a live surface in the corner of the viewport, over content
 * it had nothing to do with — so the boundary is pinned here rather than in
 * each lane that shares it.
