/**
 * OverlayIconRow — an object's verbs, overlaid just inside its top-right
 * bounds.
 *
 * Zero footprint is the whole point: no band above the object, no reserved
 * space, no layout growth, nothing that moves a line of the manuscript when it
 * appears. So the row is absolutely positioned rather than laid out — inside
 * the object's own element wherever that element belongs to a node view, and
 * measured onto the page where it does not. `object-overlay.ts` owns that
 * choice; the row only wears it.
 *
 * Each button is its own compact rounded-square card chip so it reads over
 * diagram lines, with its label in a tooltip and the row ending in ⋯. They are
 * the dense `xs` size because the row may not stand taller than one line of
 * the text it decorates (see overlay-icon-row.css). The occlusion trade is
 * accepted (the human's "literally basically inside the diagram").
 *
 * Approach chrome, not an active surface: `anchor` says which object is being
 * approached, `visible` fades the row in and out over it, and the kernel
 * suppresses the whole thing while the writer drags or sweeps. Fading rather
 * than unmounting is deliberate — a row that vanishes on the frame the pointer
 * leaves reads as a flicker, and the design asks for a fade both ways.
