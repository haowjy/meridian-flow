/**
 * EditorPopover — the editor's anchored surface (link editing, alt text, the
 * slash menu).
 *
 * Same subordination contract as `EditorMenu`: it registers as a layer so the
 * Esc chain knows about it, and closing hands the caret back to the prose.
 *
 * Two things it lets a lane decide that `EditorMenu` cannot, and one it does
 * not: focus alone never dismisses a popover here. Focus is always in motion
 * around an editor surface — a menu unmounting drops it to the body, every
 * close hands the caret back to the prose — and Radix would read each move as
 * a reason to close, killing a form on the frame it appeared. Escape and a
 * pointer outside still dismiss, which is what a writer means by it.
 *
 * **Where focus goes on the way in.** A popover holding a form takes focus,
 * because the writer opened it to type in it. A popover the writer is still
 * typing UNDERNEATH — the slash menu, filtering as the query grows — must
 * leave the caret in the prose, or the next keystroke lands in the surface.
 *
 * **Whether the anchor can move.** Both anchors are one mechanism, a virtual
 * reference floating-ui measures: `at` is a point that will never move (a
 * right-click landed there), `anchorRect` is a rect that will (the `/` the
 * writer is typing after, inside a manuscript that scrolls). Naming the
 * editor's DOM as the anchor's `contextElement` is what lets floating-ui find
 * the scroll container to watch; without it a virtual anchor only hears the
 * window.
 *
 * **No anchor is not an anchor at the origin.** An unmeasurable anchor answers
 * null — the trigger's decoration has left the DOM, the caller has nothing to
 * point at yet — and this surface then does not mount, the same answer
 * `useAnchorRect` gives measured chrome. Inventing a zero `DOMRect` put a live
 * menu in the viewport's top-left corner, over content it had nothing to do
 * with and with no way for the writer to read what it belonged to.
