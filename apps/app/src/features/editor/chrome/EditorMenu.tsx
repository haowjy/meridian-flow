/**
 * EditorMenu — the one menu every editor surface opens.
 *
 * Two anchorings, one component. A menu the writer summoned from a control
 * hangs off that control (`trigger`); a menu the context-menu router claimed
 * hangs off the pointer (`at`), through a zero-size anchor placed where the
 * click landed. Radix's DropdownMenu has no Anchor part, so that anchor is the
 * trigger — which is why anchoring lives here once instead of in six lanes.
 *
 * Radix is NOT wrapped away: it keeps ownership of dismissal, outside-click,
 * and roving focus. What this adds is subordination —
 * the open menu registers as a layer so the Esc chain knows its place, and
 * every close path hands the caret back to the prose.
 *
 * `modal={false}` deliberately: a modal menu freezes the page behind it, and
 * the page behind it is the writer's chapter. Clicking away must land the
 * caret where they clicked, not just dismiss.
