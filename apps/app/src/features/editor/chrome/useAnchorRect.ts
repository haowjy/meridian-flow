/**
 * Following an anchor: the measurement every floating surface needs.
 *
 * Object rows, the code block's chip cluster, and a link's destination hint
 * are all positioned against something in the manuscript with zero footprint
 *, so all three need the same answer to the same
 * question: where is that thing right now. And the manuscript moves. It
 * reflows when an image loads, it grows as a peer types above, and a block the
 * writer moves takes every block after it along. Anchoring is therefore a
 * measurement that repeats, and it lives here once rather than in each lane,
 * which is also why the surfaces cannot drift apart by a pixel.
 *
 * The reading is in the manuscript overlay's coordinates, never the viewport's
 * (`manuscript-overlay.ts`): a surface placed there rides scroll natively and
 * is clipped by the pane, so a scroll changes nothing this hook returns and
 * nothing it returns can be drawn outside the editor.
 *
 * WHEN to repeat it is the kernel's `watchManuscriptLayout`, shared with the
 * approach's own re-hit-testing so the two can never fall out of step.
