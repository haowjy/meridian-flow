/**
 * What a search-match door says when the passage it promised has moved on.
 *
 * Floats over the top of the document rather than pushing a strip into the
 * layout: the writer arrived to read, and a notice that shoves the page down
 * and then lets it snap back costs more attention than it gives. It blocks
 * nothing and never claims to know where the passage went.
 *
 * Purely presentational. When the notice goes is `passage-notice-store`'s
 * business, because it outlives whichever document happens to be on screen.
