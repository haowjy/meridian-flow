/**
 * The open menu a writer types underneath, headless.
 *
 * Two triggers have these physics today: `/` offering blocks (§5.7) and `[[`
 * offering documents (§5.5). In both the query IS the text after the trigger,
 * the caret never leaves what the writer is typing, and something upstream owns
 * when the menu exists and what matched — `@tiptap/suggestion`, in the editor
 * and the composer alike. This store is the whole seam between that
 * upstream and React, which is why the keyboard lives here rather than in the
 * component: the arrow keys are registered from the trigger's own lifetime, so
 * they are bound before React has rendered a single row and the first ArrowDown
 * after the trigger cannot miss.
 *
 * The menu is only `open` while it has something to offer. A filter that
 * matches nothing leaves the trigger active — backspacing brings the list
 * back — but shows no surface, because a menu with no rows is the dead control
 * law 5 forbids.
 *
 * A row that is visible but cannot be chosen is the other half of law 5, and
 * the store is where "cannot" has to live: the highlight steps over such rows
 * and Enter declines them, so a lane can show a writer why an entry refuses
 * without ever handing them a key that does nothing. A lane with no such rows
 * passes no `choosable` and nothing changes.
 *
 * `TMeta` is whatever a lane's rows need that is not a row: the slash menu's
 * group labels, say. Anything a lane reads on every row belongs in `TItem`.
