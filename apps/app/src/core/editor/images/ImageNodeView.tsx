/**
 * ImageNodeView — what an inline picture looks like at every point in its life.
 *
 * One node view for five states, because they are one node: a picture on its
 * way (dimmed frame, its own proportions, a thin progress line), a picture that
 * did not make it (the same frame, what failed, Retry and Remove), a picture
 * somebody ELSE is uploading right now (the same frame, no percent and no verbs,
 * because neither the bytes nor the retry are ours), a picture whose upload
 * never finished at all (a reload or a redo found the slot but not the bytes),
 * and a picture (the ordinary case, a signed read URL for the document its
 * `asset:` source or its `ref` names).
 *
 * A picture whose ref names nothing it can draw says which: an address nothing
 * has been uploaded to yet (it draws itself when a file lands there), or a
 * document that is gone. Neither offers Retry, because nothing a press could
 * do would change the answer.
 *
 * Which of the two empty-slot states applies is never guessed: the slot's
 * `uploadToken` plus a live owner signal says an upload is in flight, and only
 * a token nobody claims is the abandoned one (`pending-images.ts`).
 *
 * The frame is the reason completion moves nothing. Its size comes from the file
 * the writer handed over, measured locally before the upload started, and it is
 * REMEMBERED here for the rest of the node view's life: the picture's own bytes
 * arrive a moment after its `src` does, and a frame that collapsed in that gap
 * would reflow the manuscript twice for one picture.
 *
 * What is in flight arrives as a decoration rather than an attribute
 * (`pending-images.ts`): progress is the document's to show and nobody's to
 * store.
