/**
 * The ghost a picture drags with.
 *
 * A writer who clicked a big uploaded screenshot and then dragged it got the
 * picture at its FULL NATURAL SIZE following the pointer, covering the paragraph
 * they were aiming at.
 *
 * Two different things produce a preview, and which one depends on where the
 * browser decides the drag started:
 *
 * - On an unselected picture the drag starts from the node view's OUTER element,
 *   the one ProseMirror marks draggable, and nothing sets a drag image at all.
 *   The browser answers with its own snapshot of that element: the picture, at
 *   the width the prose column gave it.
 * - On a picture that is already selected the drag starts from the `<img>`
 *   itself, which is inside TipTap's node-view wrapper — so the wrapper's React
 *   `onDragStart` fires and TipTap sets a drag image of its own: a clone of the
 *   node view, off in `document.body`. Every rule that sized the picture is
 *   scoped to the editor, so none of them reach the clone: it lays out as an
 *   inline box (which ignores the width TipTap wrote on it) around an `<img>`
 *   with nothing left to bound it. 3200 pixels of screenshot, on screen.
 *
 * So this sets one preview for both paths, capped, and it has to be the LAST
 * word: TipTap's is set from a React handler, which React dispatches at its root
 * container, and the only place later than that in the same event is above the
 * root. Hence a listener on `window` rather than the editor's own DOM.
 *
 * A slot still uploading has no picture to shrink and keeps whatever the browser
 * does: its frame is a quiet label box, and there is nothing here to improve.
