/**
 * The four grips a selected picture wears, and the drag they run.
 *
 * They are rendered INSIDE the picture's own node view, which is the object
 * overlay's own default (`features/editor/chrome/object-overlay.ts`): chrome
 * that lives in the element it decorates moves with the manuscript for free —
 * no rect to re-measure, nothing to chase across a scroll, and no way to strand
 * a grip beside the paragraph that took the picture's place.
 *
 * The drag writes nothing until it ends. Each frame sets a width on the
 * picture's own box, which is geometry the writer can see and no peer can; the
 * release is the single transaction the wire and the undo stack ever hear
 * about (`image-resize.ts`).

 * that proved it, and reading the block alone let a drag push the far grips out
 * past the scroller's edge where no pointer can reach them. So every box on the

 * boundary, because a box narrower than its child is a box that clips or
 * scrolls it. The walk ends at the manuscript, which is the outermost thing a
 * picture is ever bounded by.
