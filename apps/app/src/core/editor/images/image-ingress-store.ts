/**
 * The two things about image ingress that are not in the document.
 *
 * Everything a picture's arrival puts on the page lives in the document (a
 * pending `image` node) or in the plugin state beside it. Two facts cannot:
 *
 * - **A drag is in the air.** Nothing has landed yet, so there is nothing to
 *   own it; the manuscript only dims and says where the drop will go.
 * - **A refusal.** A file that is not an image, a picker with no project
 *   behind it, a site that would not hand over its bytes: each is an event
 *   that changed nothing, and law 5 says the reason is still in view. A
 *   refusal that produced a document change would not be here — it would be
 *   labelled on the node it produced.
 *
 * The notice's life belongs to the store rather than to whoever renders it,
 * for the same reason `passage-notice-store` owns its own: the editor's
 * surfaces mount and unmount, and a message must not outlive its moment
 * because a component happened to stay mounted.
