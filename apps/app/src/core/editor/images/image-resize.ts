/**
 * How big the writer wants this picture, and the one gesture that says so.
 *
 * A picture arrives at the size of the file it came from, capped by the prose
 * column, and that is what `width: null` means — the state nearly every picture
 * is in, and the state whose wire form stays plain `![alt](src)`. Dragging a
 * corner writes a number into the document instead, so every peer draws the
 * picture the writer's size rather than their own reading of the file (the Docs model, and the way a big picture becomes small
 * enough for words to stand beside it in the line).
 *
 * Two rules make the gesture one event rather than a hundred. The drag itself
 * is GEOMETRY — a style on the element, written each frame, seen by nobody but
 * the writer — and only the release is a transaction. So the wire carries one
 * attribute change, the peers repaint once, and undo takes the whole drag back
 * in a single step.
 *
 * The size is held by identity, never by a number: the operating system is not
 * involved, but a peer or an AI write can still move the picture between the
 * press and the release, and a raw position then aims at prose.
