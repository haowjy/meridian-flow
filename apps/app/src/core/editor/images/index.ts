/**
 * What the rest of the app may ask of the editor's image lane.
 *
 * Five things, and no more: mount the two extensions, open a picture's door
 * onto a held target, ask where a picture may stand, register the app's ports,
 * and read what ingress has to say outside the document. Everything else — the
 * pending record, the decorations, the token, the upload lifecycle — is how this
 * lane keeps those promises, and a second vocabulary for it would be a second
 * way to think about a picture.
 *
 * The lane's own files import each other directly, and so do its tests.
