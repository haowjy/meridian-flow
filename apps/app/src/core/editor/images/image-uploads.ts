/**
 * A picture from this machine: the slot it takes, and what happens to that slot

 *
 * The order is the design (§5.6) and it is the whole fix: the node lands first,
 * the upload follows, and everything after is that node's business. Landing
 * writes one attribute onto the same node, so nothing is inserted at completion
 * and no line of prose moves.
 *
 * One ordering rule is not cosmetic. An upload's entry — and therefore the owner
 * signal peers read (`image-upload-presence.ts`) — is opened BEFORE the token's
 * slot reaches the document. Awareness leaves on the announcement's own
 * dispatch and the document update leaves on the insert's, so no collaborator
 * can see a slot in flight before it knows someone is filling it.
