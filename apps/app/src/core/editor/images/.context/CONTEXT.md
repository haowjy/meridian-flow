```

Each step's rule:

- **The entry opens first, then the slot.** `insertImageFile` mints the token and
  writes the entry, which is what publishes the awareness field, and only then
  inserts the node carrying that token. The order is the invariant: the owner
  signal is on the wire before the document update a peer would otherwise read as
  an abandoned slot. If the insert refuses, the entry is dropped again and the
  field released.
- **Where the node may go.** `image` is an inline atom (§5.6), so it goes inline
  where the position can hold one and in a paragraph of its own after the block
  where it cannot. A position that can take neither is the one refusal. A drop
  goes exactly where the dropcursor showed: between two words it lands in that
  sentence, at a block seam it becomes a paragraph of its own. Where it lands
  changes nothing about how big it is drawn — a picture is one object at one
  size, bounded by the prose column, sitting on the text baseline either way.
  Insert and drop are deliberately not unified — the caret is the insert's
  answer, the dropcursor is the drop's.
- **The picker takes a held target, and only a held target.** `openImagePicker`
  accepts one `ImagePickerTarget`: `{ kind: "insert", at: EditorAnchor }` for a
  new picture, `{ kind: "replace", slot: NodeHold }` for a slot the writer
  already placed. The operating system's chooser stays open across peer writes
  and AI writes, and a raw number means something else by the time a file comes
  back, so nothing may read the selection then. `imageCaretTarget` pins the
  caret for a toolbar or menu press; the slash lane pins the position its
  trigger text left behind and hands that anchor through the catalog callback.
  Both kinds are resolved after the file arrives and read back before anything
  is opened — an insert asks `acceptsInlineImage` of the resolved position, a
  replace asks `objectSurfaceKind(node) === "image"` of the resolved node — and
  a target that is gone refuses out loud rather than opening an entry or an
  upload. Neither searches for somewhere else to put the picture: a picture that
  appeared outside the table the writer asked from is a worse answer than one
  that says it cannot go. Replace then writes the token
  (`addToHistory: false`, because it is bookkeeping) and the ordinary lifecycle
  runs. It works on `figure` for the same reason it works on `image`: both carry
  the attribute, and both are registered image surfaces.
- **The frame.** `measure-image.ts` decodes the local file for its intrinsic
  size, and that size is what the slot reserves wherever it stands. The node
  view puts it on the wrapper and REMEMBERS it, because
  the picture's own bytes arrive after its `src` does and a frame that collapsed
  in that gap would reflow twice. A measured frame is that size EXACTLY, down to
  a 32px icon: the placeholder's readable minimums (8rem by 4.5rem, and 8rem by
  6rem for the loading placeholder) belong to a slot with no measured frame, and
  under one they would reserve a box the picture cannot fill. Below the size a
  placeholder can speak in, its name drops out — a container query on the frame,
  which asks the RENDERED box, because a picture wider than the prose column has
  already been narrowed by `max-width`. An unmeasurable file (an SVG with no
  intrinsic size) falls back to the default frame, which is the one case where
  completion can still move a line.
- **What lets the frame go.** A slot that is asking something rather than
  waiting — an upload that failed, one nobody can finish, a picture whose address
  would not resolve — drops the measured frame and takes the fallback box. Its
  message and its verbs do not fit inside a 32px square, nothing is going to land
  there to move the line back, and law 5 wants the refusal read and pressed.
- **Landing, and what the writer undoes.** The entry carries `landing`, which is
  how the slot was opened, because that decides the history:
  - `insert` — one transaction: `setNodeMarkup` on the same node writing `src`,
    `alt`, and `uploadToken: null`, plus the meta that drops the entry,
    `addToHistory: false`. The insert was the history event, so undo removes the
    picture rather than stepping back through the arrival of its bytes and leaving
    an empty frame.
  - `replace` — two, in this order: the token cleared outside history (an undo
    that brought it back would hand the writer a slot whose upload is over), then
    `src`/`alt` in an ordinary historical transaction. That is the whole of the
    writer's edit — this picture became that picture — and one undo takes it back.
    The non-historical write first is also what stops the replacement merging into
    the previous stack item: y-tiptap calls `stopCapturing()` for a transaction
    marked `addToHistory: false`.

  Clearing the token, either way, is what stops every peer being told the slot is
  still in flight. The fence is re-read here because an upload outlives the
  connection that started it; a fenced document turns the entry to `failed` with
  Retry instead of writing.
- **Settling.** The extension's orphan sweep and paste-import start run in a microtask
  after the view updates, never inside `update` itself: a plugin must not
  dispatch from its own update, and identity can only be read once the Yjs
  binding has finished describing the new document (`../../anchors.ts`).

## Display size

`width` is CSS pixels or null. Null means the file's own size; both are capped
by the prose column, which is `max-width: 100%` in the editor CSS and nothing
else. A stored width also wins over a measured upload frame, so a slot resized
mid-upload lands where the writer put it — the frame's ratio still holds the
box, which is what keeps the landing from moving a line.

**A table cell has to be given that cap; it cannot compute one.** A cell in an
auto-layout table is sized by what is inside it, and the picture's box carries a
width in pixels (the upload's frame, or the stored one). Percentages are dropped
while a table measures its columns, so `max-width: 100%` there is cyclic — the
column becomes as wide as the picture before the cap has anything to resolve
against, and a 1280px screenshot took a 404px table to 1352px with half the
grips across the scroller. The fence is size containment on the cell's paragraph
(`features/editor/editor.css`): the line the picture stands in is measured as if
it were empty and asks for one definite 8rem instead, so the column is decided
without the picture and the picture then fills whatever it turned out to be. It
is scoped to cells that hold a picture, so ordinary tables still size their
columns to their prose.

The gesture:

1. **Press.** `ImageResizeHandles` reads the picture's rendered box, the prose
   line height (the floor: a picture at one line is still a glyph among the
   words), and the narrowest box between the picture and the manuscript (the
   ceiling). The narrowest, not the nearest: a block can be wider than what is
   visible of it, and reading the block alone let a drag inside a table's
   scroller push the far grips out of reach. It takes a `NodeHold` on the
   picture. Nothing is dispatched.
2. **Move.** `resizedImageWidth` projects the pointer offset onto the picture's
   own diagonal — the closest box to where the pointer actually is, which is what
   makes a corner feel attached to the hand — clamps it, and the element's
   `style.width` is written. The document is untouched. A rebuild under the drag
   stops the preview and not the gesture: the hold still knows which picture it
   is.
3. **Release.** One `setNodeMarkup` through `setImageWidth`, spreading the old
   attrs so `uploadToken`, `alt`, and `title` ride through. `pointercancel`
   restores the element's old inline width and dispatches nothing.

The grips render when the ring does, over something with a box: a displayed
picture or a measured slot. A slot that is asking a question instead (failed,
abandoned, an address that would not resolve) has given its box back and has no
size to be. Selected-ness is read from the ring's own decoration
(`objectSelectedInDecorations`), which is also what `MeridianImage`'s node view
repaints on.

On the wire, a picture with no width is `![alt](src)` byte for byte and one with
a width is `<img src alt title width />` (`packages/markup/.context/CONTEXT.md`).

## Ports

```ts
type ImageUploadPort = (input: {
  file: File;
  alt: string;
  signal: AbortSignal;
  onProgress: (percent: number | null) => void;
}) => Promise<UploadedImage>;

type ImageBytesPort = (input: {
  url: string;
  filename: string;
  signal: AbortSignal;
}) => Promise<File | null>;
```

`UploadedImage.src` is always `asset:<documentId>`. `ImageBytesPort` returning
null is the ordinary answer, not an error: most of the web serves images without
the CORS headers a fetch needs.

Registration is runtime, not construction (`registerImageIngressHost`), the same
shape as the link lane's resolver port: the editor mounts before the project
query settles, and a picker with no host refuses out loud rather than opening
onto nothing.

## The paste-import seam

A pasted picture that already names a document (a same-project rich paste kept
its ref, or a drag moved it) lands as stored. One whose source is a manuscript
address is assigned the document there, or an ahead ref, through the link
lane's `assignWrittenSource`, after the asset-path translation has had its turn.
A pasted `<img src="https://…">` never becomes a document `src`. The transform
lands a link to the address (`image-workflow.ts`) and the import replaces that
link with the picture once the bytes belong to the project. The link is both the
in-flight placeholder (decorated, so the manuscript shows the import is running)
and the honest end state when the site refuses — nothing has to be undone.

Finding the link again is a three-step handoff, because a transform runs before
its transaction exists:

1. `transformPasted` records the imports it created links for.
2. `appendTransaction` reads `pastedContentRange` off the paste itself — the only
   thing that knows where its own content went — and stores it as plain numbers
   in plugin state, carried through later mappings.
3. The microtask settle pins those numbers as an anchor and starts one import per
   address. Each import owns its own entry, so a refusal cannot report for an
   import that is still working.

## Identity

An upload IS its token. `nextIngressId` mints one per arrival with a per-tab
random origin, because the string reaches the shared document and two clients
must never claim each other's slots. `slotForUploadToken` reads it back with one
`descendants` pass, so a move, a peer's whole-document rebuild, and an undo all
answer correctly with no state to carry.

Two nodes can briefly carry one token: an in-editor copy-drag duplicates the
slice attributes. Only the first receives the bytes, and the other ends as the
ordinary recoverable empty-src slot once the entry is dropped — the honest
reading of "you duplicated a picture that had not arrived". The clipboard cannot
produce this at all, because the token is not in any HTML the editor writes.

Deliberately NOT a `NodeHold`. That contract ends a held identity at a Yjs move
(`../../anchors.ts`), which is right for a gesture aimed at a node and wrong for
a slot §5.6 promises the writer may drag mid-upload. An import is the exception:
its placeholder is text, text has no attribute to carry, so it keeps an
`EditorAnchor` plus `pastedImageLinkRange`.

## Ownership across clients

| Question | Answered by |
|---|---|
| Is this slot in flight? | the node's `uploadToken` |
| Is it mine? | this editor's plugin `pending` map, keyed by that token |
| Is somebody else's, and what shape? | plugin `elsewhere`, projected from awareness by `image-upload-presence.ts` |
| Nobody's? | a token with no entry and no owner — the abandoned slot, the one that offers Remove |

The awareness field is `imageUploads`: `{ token, frame }` per in-flight slot. The
frame is there for the same reason the placeholder exists at all — a peer holding
an unshaped box would take the reflow the owner was spared. It is published from
the presence plugin's `view.update`, which runs inside the dispatch that opened
the entry, and cleared on the plugin's `destroy`. Nothing else goes on that
channel: a percent there would be a percent on the wire.

The write goes through the session's presence port
(`../../local-presence.ts`), never `Awareness.setLocalStateField`. A raw field
write is a silent no-op while local state is null, which is exactly how a
suspended presence looks (inline review, a schema fence), so an announcement made
or released behind a review would be recorded here and never sent — and the
publisher's own equality cache would then refuse to say it again. The port takes
the write either way and publishes the current field map when presence resumes.

## Invariants worth a test

- The document contains a pending node while the upload is held open.
- A landing changes only `src`, `alt`, and the token. Any other document
  difference means completion is moving the manuscript.
- One undo after a Replace restores the previous picture and reaches no further
  back; one undo after an insert removes the picture. Both belong in a real
  two-editor suite: the collaborative UndoManager is the only history there is.
- A Replace whose picture a peer replaced, moved past, or deleted while the
  chooser was open lands on the ORIGINAL picture, or on nothing at all.
- A field written while presence is suspended is on the wire after resume, and a
  released token does not come back as an owner.
- Deleting the node aborts the request and writes nothing afterwards; MOVING it in
  one delete-plus-insert transaction does not, and the bytes land where it moved.
- A peer sees an active upload as in flight, never as abandoned, in a slot already
  the picture's shape; an ownerless empty-src slot stays recoverable.
- `editor.destroy()` aborts every upload and import and releases the owner field.
- Two uploads and two imports hold independent state.
- An empty-src image round-trips through `@meridian/markup`, and a token'd one
  serializes identically with no token on the wire (its codec test).
- A resize is exactly one transaction, carries every other attribute through,
  and lands on the picture the writer grabbed after a peer writes above it.
- An unsized picture serializes byte-identically to what it always did; a sized
  one escalates and de-escalates (`packages/markup`'s codec test).
