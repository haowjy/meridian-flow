/**
 * ChromeKernelExtension — the one place the chrome kernel touches the editor.

 * Everything it decides is decided by the pure modules beside it; this file

 * Priority 1050: above every ordinary extension, below

 * writes (ruling 17) and nothing here may shadow it.
 *
 * Access it with `getEditorChrome(editor)`; the extension's own name is the
