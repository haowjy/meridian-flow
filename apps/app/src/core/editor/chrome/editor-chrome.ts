/**
 * The chrome kernel's runtime: one small store per editor holding what every
 * surface has to agree on — which layers are open, what the pointer is doing,
 * which context owns chrome, and who claims a right-click.
 *
 * Headless and editor-free on purpose. It holds no `Editor`, dispatches no
 * transaction, and touches no DOM; `ChromeKernelExtension` is the one thing
 * that reads this store and acts on the document. That split is what lets the
 * walk-home policy, the claim table, and suppression be tested as data.
 *
 * Surface exclusivity is NOT here. Radix already makes menus, popovers, and
 * dialogs mutually exclusive layers, and hover rows are approach chrome rather
 * than active surfaces (decision 2026-07-29). A surface registers with
 * `openLayer` so the Esc chain knows about it; it does not ask permission to
 * exist.
