/**
 * The context-menu claim table: which editor menu takes the right-click, and
 * the one gesture that gives it back to the browser.
 *
 * Every right-click inside the editor opens an editor menu, and the context
 * picks which one (it replaces the earlier fall
 * through to the browser at a bare caret). A writer who right-clicked in a
 * table cell and got the browser's list of nothing they wanted is what settled
 * it: the editor's verbs are the answer the gesture is asking for.
 *
 * The browser's menu is still reachable, and reachable deliberately:
 * **Shift+right-click is never claimed**. Spellcheck suggestions, lookup, and
 * OS services exist in the native menu and nowhere else, so the escape has to
 * be a gesture rather than an absence of one.
 *
 * The decision must be synchronous, inside the `contextmenu` event, because
 * `preventDefault` after the event has returned does nothing. Opening the
 * claimed surface may be deferred a tick; deciding may not.
 *
 * Pure. The runtime kernel owns the DOM listener and calls `resolveContextClaim`.

/**
 * Claim precedence, strongest first (§5.1's ownership split). A link inside a
 * selection is still a link — the deepest context wins — so `link` leads.
 *
 * `grip` and `object` are one entry in the design ("object/grip"): they never
 * both match, because a grip is chrome drawn outside the frame and an object
 * is a node inside it. Grip is spelled first as the more specific of the two,
 * so a future grip drawn OVER its table still resolves to the grip.
 *
 * `cell-selection` is second to last because it is the widest selection: a
 * rectangle of table cells the writer swept by hand. A link inside one is
 * still a link, a grip over one is still a grip, and the rung exists because
 * nothing above it wants a `CellSelection` — `text-selection` admits
 * `TextSelection` and `AllSelection` only, which left a swept rectangle with
 * no menu at all.
 *
 * `caret` is the floor, and it matches everywhere the rungs above it declined:
 * a caret in prose, in a table cell, or in a code fence. It is a rung rather
 * than a kernel default because WHICH menu opens is the owning lane's answer,
 * and the lanes are disjoint by context — the formatting menu takes prose and
 * cells, the fence takes its own.
