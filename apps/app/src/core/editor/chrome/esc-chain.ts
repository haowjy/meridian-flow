/**
 * Esc walks home (law 3): one key, one step, one direction, from anywhere.
 *
 * The kernel owns the chain; surfaces own only their own dismissal. A surface
 * registers itself as a layer while it is open and the chain decides when its
 * turn comes, so no surface has to know what else might be above or below it —
 * which is the only way "nobody is ever trapped" can be a property of the
 * editor rather than a hope about every lane.
 *
 * The three-step walk law 3 spells out (source → object selected → caret after
 * the object) is not three cases here. A diagram's source room is a pane inside
 * its dialog, so both are layers: closing the source pane lands on the viewer,
 * closing the viewer lands on the page with the object still selected, and the
 * next Esc drops the caret after it. A code block is the design's stated
 * exception (§5.3) — its rendering IS its source, so there is no room to leave
 * and Esc goes straight to the caret after the block.
 *
 * An object whose insides are prose walks the same three steps with a
 * different first one: a caret in a table cell is standing INSIDE the object,
 * so Esc selects the table, and only the next Esc leaves it.
 *
 * Pure. `escStep` decides; the caller performs. `advanceEscSituation` models
 * the performance so the chain can be proved terminating without an editor.
