/**
 * The editor's keymap seam: where a surface contributes keys, and who wins
 * when two want the same one.
 *
 * TipTap resolves key conflicts by extension priority — a number, decided once
 * at construction, invisible from the surface that loses. This turns that into
 * data: a contribution names its scope, the scopes are an ordered list, and
 * the deepest owner is tried first (law 4). A surface open right now beats the
 * object under it, which beats the table around it, which beats the document.
 *
 * Inside the deepest scope the same question repeats, because layers nest: a
 * dialog and the pane it opened are both `layer` scope. So a layer's keys name
 * the layer that owns them, and the chord goes to the deepest OPEN one that
 * claimed it. Registration order cannot answer that — React mounts child
 * effects before parent effects, so the pane registers first and the dialog
 * would take the chord the pane was open to answer.
 *
 * Above all of it sits `UndoRedoKeymapExtension` at TipTap priority 1100,
 * which is not part of this ladder and must not be: undo is the writer's
 * recovery over LLM writes (ruling 17), so no contribution can shadow it.
 * The kernel mounts at priority 1050 — under undo, over everything else.
 *
 * Contributions register at runtime, which is the point: a slash menu needs
 * the arrow keys only while it is open, and an extension priority cannot say
 * "only while open".
 *
 * ProseMirror is not the only place a key arrives. A layer whose content Radix
 * portals out of the editor holds focus for as long as it is open, and the
 * editor's own `handleKeyDown` never runs for it — so a contribution says how
 * far it reaches (`KeymapReach`) and the kernel listens on the document for the
 * ones that reach past the prose. That is the seam a surface extends instead of
 * adding a document listener of its own, which would be invisible to scope,
 * precedence, and the registration validator alike.

 * them), two layers do not (depth orders them), and neither does anything that
 * narrows with `appliesTo` — a narrowed pair is the deliberate chain the merge
 * runs, where declining hands the key down. What is left is the case no reader
 * can resolve: same place, same key, neither narrowing, one of the two
 * silently unreachable.

 * still names the lane that wrote the binding, and the registry has not been

 * every other lane nothing. Validating late once cost every later registration
