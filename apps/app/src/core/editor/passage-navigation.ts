/**
 * Open a document and land on the passage a search result promised.
 *
 * Same shape as `change-trail-navigation`: retain the session, wait for this
 * document's Yjs sync, then resolve against live state — because an anchor is
 * only meaningful once the document the writer is looking at is the document
 * the anchor was made against. Opening is deliberately not part of it: a
 * search row is a document door first, and the door opens whether or not the
 * passage inside it can still be found.
 *
 * What differs is the anchor. A trail change carries encoded relative
 * positions; a search hit carries a block hash and the term that matched.
 * The hash is Yjs-durable at block granularity — it derives from the block's
 * immutable item id, so it survives every edit inside the block and dangles
 * only when the block itself goes. The term is what turns "a block" into "the
 * passage": finding the block is not the same as the passage still being
 * there, and only the term can tell the two apart.
 *
 * The ladder lives in `passage-resolution.ts`. This module owns the timing.
