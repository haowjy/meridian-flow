/**
 * One client's own presence: the fields it publishes, and whether they are on
 * the wire at all.
 *
 * Awareness carries two kinds of local fact — the caret y-prosemirror writes,
 * and fields the app publishes itself (which slots this browser is filling,
 * `images/image-upload-presence.ts`) — while something else entirely decides
 * whether this client should be visible right now: inline review hides the
 * writer's presence in the document behind it, and a schema fence hides a
 * client that may no longer write.
 *
 * Those two questions used to have two owners, and the seam between them lost
 * writes. Yjs' `setLocalStateField` is a silent no-op while local state is
 * null, which is exactly what "suspended" looks like, so a publisher that wrote
 * during suspension recorded a change that never happened — and suspension
 * restored the snapshot it took, resurrecting the value the publisher had
 * already corrected.
 *
 * So one owner holds both: while presence is live, Awareness IS the desired
 * state and a field write goes straight to it. Suspension is the only moment
 * the two can differ, and for exactly that span this holds the desired map:
 * writes land in it, the transport publishes null, and resume publishes the map
 * as it now stands rather than as it was when the writer opened the review.
 *
 * Upstream collaboration plugins know nothing about any of that: TipTap's
 * CollaborationCaret and y-prosemirror's cursor plugin write `user` and
 * `cursor` onto whatever Awareness their provider hands them. So they are
 * handed `caretProvider` instead of the real one. It wears Awareness' shape and
 * routes every local write and read back through this owner, which is why a
 * caret the destroyed editor cleared behind a review stays cleared when the
 * review ends.
