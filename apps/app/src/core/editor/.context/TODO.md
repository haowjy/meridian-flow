# Editor — TODO

## Make collaboration restart and save status honest

`DocumentSession.restartTransport()` destroys the old Hocuspocus provider and
then gives the replacement provider the same session-owned `Awareness` object.
Hocuspocus 4.3 destroys caller-supplied Awareness in `provider.destroy()`, so a
terminal authorization recovery can reuse an object whose state, listeners, and
stale-peer timer are already gone. Keep the provider/Awareness stable while
replacing or pausing only the room socket, or make provider ownership explicit;
then probe remote caret disappearance and restoration across terminal recovery.

Do not promote Hocuspocus 4.3's `unsyncedChanges === 0` to an ongoing durable
"saved" claim: reconnect resets the counter to one even when several update
messages are queued. Define the acknowledgement horizon the UI needs before
surfacing saved state. Also surface an authorized editable session that remains
`detached`; `SyncStatus.tsx` currently hides it, which made a permanently
local-only manuscript indistinguishable from a healthy one.

Affected paths: `apps/app/src/core/editor/document-session.ts`,
`apps/app/src/core/transport/hocuspocus-document-transport.ts`, and
`apps/app/src/features/editor/SyncStatus.tsx`.

## Draft review

- **Cursor preservation across live ↔ draft remount.** Scroll uses best-effort
  layout restoration, but selection/cursor restoration is still not deliberate.
- **Review ownership consolidation.** Review entry/exit, preview fetching,
  fallback routing, inline model sync, sidebar state, and discard commands are
  still spread across provider/hooks/components. Collapse them behind one deep
  controller when the interaction model settles.
- **Narrow viewport review parity.** The right rail intentionally hides below
  `lg`; make sure the docked diff panel keeps feature parity for any new
  Discard-class actions.

## Prove a block move leaves every other block's hash alone — [#111]

[#111]: https://github.com/haowjy/meridian-flow/issues/111

Dragging a figure into place ships: the registry marks a figure `drag: "block"`,
so the figure itself is a drag handle, and every move goes through
`moveBlockToSeamTransaction` — a delete of the source followed by an insert at
the seam. ProseMirror's own HTML5 drag is refused wherever it would carry a
block object, because it moves a node by serializing and re-parsing it.

What is still missing is the assertion that this is true: a test that moves a
figure and shows every OTHER block keeping its hash while the moved figure
gets a fresh Yjs item id. That contract is agent-edit's ("block hash = stable
block identity", `packages/agent-edit/.context/write-invariants.md`), and
y-prosemirror would break it silently by reconciling a reorder slot-wise.

Keep any schema-spec change mirrored between `apps/app/src/core/editor` and
`packages/prosemirror-schema`; the two schemas are built separately and parity
is currently unenforced.

## Task lists have a schema and a codec but no writer surface

`list_item.checked` is in the shared schema and `packages/markup` reads and
writes GFM `- [ ] ` / `- [x] ` items, so an AI write or a paste can put a task
list into a manuscript the writer then cannot author or toggle. TipTap's
TaskList/TaskItem are deliberately not registered: they add `taskList` and
`taskItem` node types the shared schema does not have. A writer surface means
an input rule and a keymap over the existing `list_item` + `checked`, plus a
checkbox in the list item's DOM, not the upstream nodes.

Found while pinning the markdown autoformat truth table
(`extensions/MarkdownAutoformatExtension.test.ts`); ruling 18 did not name it.
