/**
 * Where a searched passage is in the document *now* — the honest half of a
 * search-match door.
 *
 * A search result names a block and the term that matched it. Between the
 * search and the click the writer may have edited, moved or deleted that
 * block, so arriving means re-deciding, against live text, whether the promise
 * can still be kept. Three outcomes, and no fourth: the passage is where it
 * said, the passage is somewhere unambiguous, or we say it changed. (An empty term
 * means the server had no text to give: the block alone is the landing.) Landing on
 * a nearby-but-wrong paragraph is the failure this module exists to refuse.
 *
 * Pure over a ProseMirror document: no editor, no Yjs, no timing.
 *
 * The searchable projection is the delicate part. It must find exactly what the
 * server's search would find, and nothing the writer did not write: text either
 * side of a line break or an image is not one word, and case folding is neither
 * length-preserving nor context-free in every language.

 * and `keeper` read as `gatekeeper` — a term the writer never wrote, offered
 * as the unique occurrence step 3 is allowed to jump to. Splitting makes
 * contiguity structural rather than a separator character we hope nobody
 * searches for.
 *
 * **A whole run folds at once, because case is contextual.** `"ΟΣ"` lowercases
 * to `"ος"` with a final sigma, while folding its letters one at a time gives
 * `"οσ"` — which fails to match the server's needle and happily matches the
 * `"ος"` inside a later `"πύργος"`. The server folds whole strings, so a run
 * is the smallest unit that can agree with it.
 *
 * **Folded length is still not source length.** `"İ".toLowerCase()` is two
 * code units, so every folded unit carries the range of the source code point
 * behind it, walked by code point so a surrogate pair is never split. The
 * contextual substitutions are one-for-one, which is what lets that per-code-
 * point count describe the whole-run fold; when the two ever disagree in
 * length, the run is searched through the text its own map describes rather
 * than reporting a position we cannot justify. Marks also cut text into
 * several nodes, which is why this walks children instead of `textContent`.
