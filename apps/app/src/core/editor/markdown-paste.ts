/**
 * The markdown door for clipboard text.
 *
 * Everything in a Meridian document is markdown, so text arriving on the
 * clipboard is read as the document it describes rather than the characters it
 * contains: a writer, or the AI relay they are working with, who pastes
 * headings, lists, fences, tables and links gets headings, lists, fences,
 * tables and links. `@meridian/markup`'s `markdownCodec` is the same GFM parser
 * the wire uses, wikilinks included, so nothing here has to know what markdown
 * looks like.
 *
 * `markdownCodec` and not `mdxCodec`: the clipboard carries text from anywhere,
 * and MDX reads `<` and `{` as syntax. Fiction contains both.
 *
 * The door only opens when it has something to offer. ProseMirror's own
 * plain-text paste already produces paragraphs of literal text, so a parse that
 * amounts to those same paragraphs is declined and the default runs instead:
 * ordinary pasted prose never takes a detour through a parser that could
 * re-spell it. `markdownPasteAddsStructure` is that decision, made on the
 * parsed blocks rather than on a guess about the raw text.

 *
 * What deliberately does not: paragraphs of plain text, however many. That is
 * the false-positive guard. A soft-wrapped line, a `#` inside a sentence, an
 * asterisk used as punctuation — each parses to plain paragraphs, so the codec
