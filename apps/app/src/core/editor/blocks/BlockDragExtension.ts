/**
 * The document's memory of a block being dragged: which one the pointer has
 * hold of, and whether it has been lifted yet.
 *
 * The block surface could not keep this itself. Two things make it the
 * document's business rather than React's:
 *
 * - **The manuscript has to show it.** A lifted block reads at half opacity
 *   (§5.8), and the only way to style a node ProseMirror renders is a
 *   decoration. Setting an attribute on the element by hand does not survive:
 *   ProseMirror's DOM observer treats an unexpected attribute change as
 *   corruption and re-renders the node without it.
 * - **The position has to survive the drag.** A peer's edit or an AI write can
 *   land while the pointer is down (law 9 — nothing gates a write), and the
 *   block the writer grabbed has to still be the block that lands. One held
 *   position, here, rather than one per consumer — and an `EditorAnchor`,
 *   because a remote write replaces the whole document and a mapped number
 *   would report the grabbed block deleted every time.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the document. The transactions carry meta only, so no
 * step reaches Yjs and no undo entry appears for picking a paragraph up.
