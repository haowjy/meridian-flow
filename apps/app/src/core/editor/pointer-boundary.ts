/**
 * Where a press that landed OUTSIDE the prose puts the caret.
 *
 * The editor pane has no click-dead margins (user call 2026-07-16): a press on
 * the page gutter, the padding below the last block, or the inert strip between
 * two blocks is caret territory. That press has no ProseMirror position of its
 * own — it is answered here, once, for every block kind alike. A lane shipping
 * a new block view adds nothing: the answer reads the object registration
 * (`objects/object-types.ts`), never a node name.
 *
 * Two rules make the answer safe, and both exist because a caret in DOM the
 * writer cannot see eats every keystroke it is given:
 *
 * 1. **An outside press never lands in an opaque object's interior.** A
 *    rendered diagram, a picture, a rule: the body stands in for text that is
 *    not on screen, so `posAtCoords` finding that hidden text is an accident of
 *    geometry, not an intention.
 * 2. **A press in the seam BETWEEN two blocks prefers prose to source.** A
 *    seam belongs to neither block, so a fence does not volunteer for it. A
 *    press ON a fence's own band (the gutter beside it) still enters it —
 *    that text is visible, and the writer is pointing at it.
 *
 * Both policies are geometry-independent, and cells hold any block now (§4 of
 * the cell addendum), so the same walk answers one level down: the bands may
 * be a CELL's children instead of the document's, and then a third rule joins
 * the two — a press inside a cell resolves inside that cell, never a
 * neighbouring cell and never the document. The cell is isolating; an answer
 * that leaves it is a wrong answer, not a nearest one.
