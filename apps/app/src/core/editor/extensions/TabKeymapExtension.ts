/**
 * The editor owns Tab and Shift-Tab, and never hands them back.
 *
 * Tab makes a tab. That is what a writer expects from every editor they have
 * come from, and it is the one thing the browser's own Tab refuses to be: its
 * Tab is a focus move. TipTap's table and list extensions bind the key where
 * they have something to do and REFUSE it everywhere else, and a refusal is a
 * leak — in a heading, in a paragraph, on the first list item, DOM focus lands
 * on the nearest button in the app chrome while the ProseMirror selection
 * stays where it was, and every keystroke after that is discarded in silence.
 *
 * So the rule is `UndoRedoKeymapExtension`'s: ownership that lapses on a
 * refusal is not ownership. Every binding here consumes its key, and the only
 * question is what it does with it, deepest owner first:
 *
 * - in a table, Tab walks cells — a grid has no room for indentation — unless
 *   the caret stands in a list item or a fence INSIDE a cell, where the walk
 *   declines and the deeper owner's rung below answers;
 * - in a code fence, it indents, line-wise when something is selected;
 * - in a list, it sinks or lifts the item, refusal included;
 * - anywhere else in prose, it inserts one tab character.
 *
 * Prose tabs reach the wire intact (law 9): a tab mid-line is literal
 * markdown, while a LEADING tab would parse back as an indented code block,
 * so the codec writes that one as `&#x9;` and reads it back as a tab. The
 * round trip is pinned in `packages/markup`'s codec test, which is what makes
 * this key safe to hand a writer.
 *
 * Registering through the kernel — rather than an `addKeyboardShortcuts` at
 * some priority number — is what puts those four cases on one ladder, and
 * what lets a future surface take Tab at `layer` scope while it is open
 * without touching this file.
