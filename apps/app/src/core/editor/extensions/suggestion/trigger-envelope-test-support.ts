/**
 * The envelope both suggestion triggers share, as rows.
 *
 * `/`, `[[`, and `@` differ in their boundary rules — two need a word boundary,
 * two refuse an existing link — but the places a trigger may open at all are one
 * decision, held in `trigger-envelope.ts` and read by every predicate. So the
 * containers and the source refusals are one corpus, consumed by every lane
 * suite, and a block that becomes prose (or stops being it) is one row here
 * rather than an edit in each.
 *
 * Lane-specific rules stay in the lane's own suite: this corpus says where a
 * trigger may open, never what a trigger is.
