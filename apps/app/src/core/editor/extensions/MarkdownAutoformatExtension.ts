/**
 * Markdown that transforms as the writer types.
 *
 * Most of the surface is inherited rather than written: TipTap's node and mark
 * extensions already ship GFM input rules, its engine already refuses to run
 * them inside anything whose spec is `code`, and because the Meridian wrappers
 * only rename types those rules resolve the server-parity names (`strong`,
 * `em`, `bullet_list`, `code_block`). Reimplementing them here would be a
 * second set of rules competing for the same keystrokes. Inherited unchanged:
 * `# `…`###### ` headings, `**b**` / `*i*` / `~~s~~` / `` `c` `` marks, `> `
 * blockquote, `- ` / `* ` / `+ ` bullets, `1. ` ordered lists, `---` divider,
 * and completion on Enter as well as on space.
 *
 * What this extension owns is the remaining autoformat behavior: the code
 * fence's info string, and Backspace. Typed `[[name]]` is text: the `[[`
 * picker is how a writer links a document. The truth table
 * beside it pins the whole surface, inherited rules included, so an upgrade
 * that drops a trigger fails loudly instead of quietly.

 * backtick fence's info string and forbids nothing inside a tilde fence's, so
 * ` ~~~aa~bb ` is a language and ` ~~~~ ` is a longer fence with none. The run
 * is greedy for the same reason GFM's own parser is.
 *
 * TipTap's rule captures `[a-z]+` and no run at all, so ` ```Python `,
 * ` ```c++ ` and ` ```ts-node ` matched nothing and left the writer holding
