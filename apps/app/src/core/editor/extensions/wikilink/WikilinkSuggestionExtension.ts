/**
 * The `[[` lane: two brackets in prose open the document menu (§5.5).
 *
 * The same mechanism the slash lane uses, because a writer meets both the same
 * way — the query is the prose, the caret stays in it, and Escape leaves the
 * literal `[[` text alone. What differs is only what this offers and what a
 * choice writes: `wikilink-trigger.ts` says where it may open,
 * `@/core/completion`'s catalog says what matched, and `wikilink-insertion.ts`
 * says what lands in the document.
 *
 * `allowSpaces` is on, and has to be: document titles have spaces in them, and
 * a menu that stopped filtering at "The Second" would be a menu that cannot
 * find "The Second Gate". The cost is that the match runs to the end of the
 * text node, which is why the catalog refuses a query carrying `]` — a writer
 * who closed the brackets themselves is left alone with their own text.
