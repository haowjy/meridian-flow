/**
 * What choosing a row does to the document.
 *
 * One shape, and the wire format is why: the codec spells a link as
 * `[[target]]` only when the link's text IS its target and it carries no
 * title. Anything else round-trips as `[text]([[target]])`, which is not a
 * wikilink at all. So the inserted text is the name, exactly, and the href is
 * the classifier's own spelling of it rather than brackets pasted together
 * here.
 *
 * A name the link system will not accept inserts nothing: the menu never
 * writes something into the manuscript that the resolver, the hint, and the
 * click would each read as a different thing.
