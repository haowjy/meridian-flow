/**
 * The auto-pair truth table, derived from the registry it is about.
 *
 * Every case here types real characters through the same `handleTextInput` path
 * a browser drives and presses real keys through the keymap, because the whole
 * feature is about what a keystroke becomes. The cases that matter most are the
 * refusals: a pair that fires where the writer did not want it, or a closing
 * keystroke that vanishes, costs far more than the convenience is worth.
 *
 * The mechanism rows come from `EDITOR_AUTO_PAIRS` itself — every row in every
 * context it declares, and every context it leaves out — so a new pair is one
 * production edit and arrives with opener, step-over, Backspace, and
 * wrong-context coverage already. What is written out by hand below is what the
 * registry cannot say: the boundary rules around the caret, nesting, and the
 * gestures that degrade to plain insertion.
