/**
 * Typing an opener writes its closer; typing the closer walks back out of it.
 *
 * Three gestures, one mechanism, all of it reading
 * [`auto-pairs.ts`](auto-pairs.ts):
 *
 * - **open** — `[` inserts `[]` and leaves the caret between them, in one
 *   transaction, so one undo takes the whole gesture back;
 * - **step over** — the closer the writer types where this plugin already
 *   wrote one moves the caret past it instead of doubling it;
 * - **unpair** — Backspace between the two halves takes both.
 *
 * **The step is only ever over a closer this plugin wrote.** That is what the
 * plugin state holds: the positions of the closers it inserted, mapped forward
 * through every transaction and dropped the moment their position is deleted.
 * A writer's own `]` is their own text and typing `]` in front of it writes a
 * second one, which is what they asked for. Everything in this file fails
 * toward plain insertion — remote collab edits replace the whole document and
 * take the whole table with them (see `anchors.ts` for why positions cannot
 * survive that), and a keystroke that lands as itself is a far smaller cost
 * than a keystroke that disappears.
 *
 * Positions are held only across transactions that map them, never read back
 * from a stale state: every step and every unpair re-reads the character in
 * the document before trusting the entry that pointed at it.

 * and the diff read back from the DOM is the whole block; select-all followed
