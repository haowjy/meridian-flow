/**
 * Where `/` opens the menu — the whole envelope, as one pure predicate.
 *
 * The old slash menu's failure (F6) was not a bad rule but an undefined one:
 * the trigger was gated on preconditions nobody had written down, so a writer
 * who typed `/` and got a literal slash had no way to learn why. This function
 * IS the contract (§5.7), and `slash-trigger.test.ts` is its truth table:
 *
 * - opens at the start of a text block, or immediately after whitespace
 * - in paragraphs (empty or not), headings, list items, quote paragraphs, and
 *   table cells, all of which are one of two node types once resolved
 * - never mid-word, never inside a code fence (which is also the diagram's
 *   source), and nowhere else is denied
 *
 * Everything the trigger needs is in the document, so nothing here reads the
 * editor, the catalog, or the view. A caller that wants "and the catalog is
 * live" composes that itself.
