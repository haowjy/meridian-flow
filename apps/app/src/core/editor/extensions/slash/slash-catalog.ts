/**
 * The slash catalog — what the menu offers, and who says so.
 *
 * This is the seam that survived the toolkit demolition (§8: "salvage the
 * catalog getter, rewrite the trigger"): the item shape, the fuzzy filter, and
 * the read-at-open getter. The host owns the catalog because the labels are
 * localized and the image entry needs the host's file picker; everything else
 * in this directory builds around it.
 *
 * Ids are a closed union on purpose. The surface renders an icon per id and
 * `slash-insertion.ts` builds a node per id, so an entry that reached the
 * catalog without either is a compile error rather than a blank row.
