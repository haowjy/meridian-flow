/**
 * The slash lane: `/` in prose opens the insertion menu (§5.7).
 *
 * Four modules meet here and none of them is this file's business.
 * `slash-trigger.ts` decides where `/` may open, `slash-catalog.ts` is what the
 * host is offering, `slash-insertion.ts` decides what a choice does to the
 * document, and [`../suggestion/`](../suggestion/suggestion-lane.ts) owns the
 * lifecycle every typed-under menu shares. What is left is the spec that names
 * them.
 *
 * Everything this lane does NOT own — Escape, transaction-origin gating, the
 * catalog fence, the arrow keys' timing — is owned once by the lane mechanism,
 * and the reasoning lives there.
