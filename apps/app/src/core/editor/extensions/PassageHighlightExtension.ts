/**
 * The landing a search-match door promises: a transient mark on the words that
 * matched, and a scroll only when the writer cannot already see them.
 *
 * **Never a selection.** A selection would move the writer's cursor, and the
 * writer may be mid-sentence somewhere else. This marks; it does not take.
 *
 * The mark is short-lived by contract. It fades on its own, and it clears the
 * moment the writer does anything — types, moves the caret, or undoes — because
 * from then on the document is their business again. A peer's edit is not the
 * writer moving: those arrive constantly and would otherwise wipe the mark
 * before it was read.
 *
 * Telling the two apart needs care. Collaborative undo is the writer's own
 * keystroke, but it reaches ProseMirror through the same ySync channel a peer's
 * edit does, so the metadata has to be read rather than merely noticed.
