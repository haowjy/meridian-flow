/**
 * Where `[[` opens the link picker — the whole envelope, as one predicate.

 * The trigger has to be readable in one place (§5.5, and the lesson §5.7
 * learned the hard way). The rule:
 *
 * - anywhere in prose the writer is composing a sentence in: paragraphs,
 *   headings, list items, quote paragraphs, and table cells, all of which
 *   resolve to one of two node types
 * - never inside a code fence, which is source rather than prose, and is also
 *   the diagram's editing pane
 * - never inside an existing link, where `[[` is text the writer is correcting
 *   rather than a new link they are starting
 *
 * Unlike `/`, `[[` needs no word boundary: two brackets are already an
 * unambiguous request, and a link legitimately follows an opening quote or
 * parenthesis with nothing between.
