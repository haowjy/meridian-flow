/**
 * The link lane's per-editor store: which link is being approached, and which
 * of its two summoned surfaces is open.
 *
 * Headless and editor-free, like the chrome kernel's own store. The extension
 * beside it turns pointers and keys into these calls; React reads the state
 * with `useSyncExternalStore` and renders. Nothing here touches the document,
 * so the whole surface policy is testable as data.
 *
 * The hint is approach chrome and the other two are summoned surfaces, so they
 * are separate fields rather than one "current surface": a hover that lands
 * while a menu is open must not close the menu, and a menu that opens must not
 * have to remember to clear a hint.
