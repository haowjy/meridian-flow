/**
 * Drawing what the resolver answered, without storing any of it.
 *
 * The state rides a decoration rather than a schema attribute, which is the
 * whole point of law 9: `[[The Second Gate]]` from an LLM needs no extra
 * attributes to render correctly, and nothing about whether it resolves ever
 * reaches the wire or another peer's document. A decoration is also the only
 * shape that can change without a write, and this one changes as soon as an
 * answer lands.
 *
 * ProseMirror puts an inline decoration's attributes on a span INSIDE the link
 * mark's `<a>`, so the CSS reaches the anchor through `:has()`. That is a fact
 * about how marks and decorations nest, not a choice — see the link
 * surface's `link-surfaces.css`.
