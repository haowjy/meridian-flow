# core/editor/links — the link lane, headless

What pressing a link does and which surface is open. React lives in
[`features/editor/surfaces/link/`](../../../features/editor/surfaces/link/AGENTS.md);
nothing here renders.

**What an href means and what it points at are not here.** The classifier and
the href-keyed resolution store are [`@/core/links`](../../links/AGENTS.md),
because the chat transcript asks both questions and has no ProseMirror in it.
This lane is everything that reads a document: the mark commands, the click
decision, the surface store, the decoration that draws an answer.

## Mental model

**One classifier, four kinds.** `classifyLinkTarget` turns an href into
`wikilink | scheme | relative | external`, and every consumer reads that one
answer: the click, the hover hint, the menu, the mark's own rendering, the
paste sanitizer. The first three are the *internal family* — three spellings,
one behavior (§5.5) — and are exactly the server's `DocumentLinkTarget`, so
`documentLinkTarget()` is a projection, not a translation. `external` is the
client's alone and never crosses the resolution port.

**Following is a decision, then a destination.** `linkClickIntent` decides
whether a press follows or places the caret, and where a follow goes;
`followLink` sends an external target to a new tab and an internal one to a
navigator the app registers. No navigator is a real state, not a bug — the
click falls through to the caret and the menu omits Open link rather than
offering a dead verb.

**The store is the surface policy.** `link-surface.ts` holds which link is
being approached and which of the two summoned surfaces is open;
`LinkSurfaceExtension` is the only thing that reads the document, watches the
pointer, and calls into it.

## Key rules

- **A new link spelling is added to `classifyLinkTarget` (in
  [`@/core/links`](../../links/AGENTS.md)) and nowhere else.** A consumer that
  pattern-matches an href itself is the drift that module exists to prevent.
- **The classifier is also the security fence.** An href outside both families
  is `null`, and null means no hint, no follow, no Open verb, and no rendered
  destination. `MeridianLink` asks it on parse, on command, and on render,
  because the markdown parser is a third door into the document.
- **A link in the manuscript never navigates the browser.** The plugin cancels
  that unconditionally, on `click` and `auxclick` alike; what happens instead is
  this module's decision. A follow also puts the selection back where the press
  found it — reading a link is not moving the writer's place.
- **A surface that outlives a keystroke holds a `LinkAnchor`, never raw
  positions.** Every remote write rebuilds the whole document, so ProseMirror's
  mapping has nothing to say about where anything went; Yjs relative positions
  do. And position alone is never enough: re-read the mark and compare it, or
  the surface acts on whatever slid into the coordinates.
- **Unresolved is normal, not an error.** Serial writers link chapters before
  they write them, so an internal target that resolves to nothing is a state
  the UI renders, never a failure it reports. A request that *failed* is a
  third thing: no answer at all, rendered as an ordinary link.
- **Invalidation is a registration, and a registration is a generation.**
  Registering the port starts a generation that owns its answers, its one
  question per href, its queue, and its in-flight counter; a question settles
  against the generation that asked it, never against whatever is waiting under
  that href now. The app registers again when the scope or the project's
  document catalog changes, so there is no `refresh`-shaped verb to call and no
  reason for a mutation site to reach in here.
- **No resolution is ever stored.** The state rides a decoration, not a schema
  attribute (law 9), so `[[Chapter 214]]` from an LLM needs no extra
  attributes and no peer receives an answer that was true in someone else's
  project.
- **The decorations are mapped on an ordinary keystroke and rebuilt only when
  something reached a link** — a mark step, an edit inside one, an answer
  landing. The exception is a remote write: mapping across the whole-document
  replace reports every position deleted and would erase the drawing, so
  `isRemoteDocumentRebuild` rebuilds instead.
- Register keys and claims from the plugin's `view()`, never TipTap's
  `onCreate` — it fires a macrotask late and the first Ctrl+K misses it.

## Anti-patterns

- A second normalizer for writer input, or a second scheme list.
- A cache-poking call at a mutation site. Whatever changed the project changed
  the document catalog, and the catalog is what the resolution scope watches.
- A surface reaching past the store into `editor.storage`.
- Gating an AI write on link validity. Marks inform; nothing approves.
