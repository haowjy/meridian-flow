/**
 * What a click on a link does, and where following it goes.
 *
 * Ruling 4: click follows. That is Notion's behavior and it is the one the
 * design picked, even inside an editable surface — hover has already shown the
 * destination, so no click is blind. The caret is still reachable: Alt+Click,
 * or any click that travelled far enough to be a drag, places it instead.
 *
 * Ruling 9 settles the external guard: none. A click on an external link opens
 * the new tab immediately, because a stray tab is cheaper than a tax on every
 * deliberate follow. If that is ever reopened (mockup 06 state F), the whole
 * flip is `linkClickIntent` returning a third action and the surface rendering
 * a chip — no consumer of this module learns a new shape.
