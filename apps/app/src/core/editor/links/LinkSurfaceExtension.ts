/**
 * LinkSurfaceExtension — the one place the link lane touches the editor.
 *
 * It owns the click (follow or caret, `link-navigation.ts` decides), the hover
 * that reveals the destination, Ctrl+K, Alt+Enter, the right-click claim, and
 * the decoration that says whether an internal link has landed anywhere yet.
 * Everything it decides is decided by the pure modules beside it; this file
 * reads the document, watches the pointer, and calls the stores.
 *
 * It also owns link clicks outright: the link mark used to cancel navigation
 * from its own plugin, which would now be a second opinion about the same
 * event. The schema says what a link IS; this says what pressing one DOES.
 *
 * Priority is left at the default — the kernel (1050) and object physics
 * (1040) both sit above, which is right: an object under the pointer is a
 * deeper owner than a mark on its text.
