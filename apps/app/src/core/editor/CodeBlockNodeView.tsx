/**
 * The fence's node view — the diagram the page shows instead of syntax.
 *
 * A `code_block` whose language a diagram provider claims renders as a diagram
 * and hides its own `<pre>`; every other language is the fence itself
 * (interaction model §5.2). WHICH languages render is the catalog's answer
 * (`diagrams/diagram-providers.ts`), never a name in this file; the three faces
 * the render layer wears are `DiagramBody`. What this file owns is the one
 * choice above them, which is whether the writer is looking at the diagram or at
 * its source.
 *
 * ## The invariant
 *
 * **A selection inside the fence implies a visible, connected source content
 * DOM, and rendering that implication must not itself change the selection.**
 *
 * The first half is why the source comes back at all: a caret in a hidden
 * element eats every keystroke it is given. The second half is structural, and
 * it is what the DOM below is shaped by:
 *
 * - the content host is the wrapper's FIRST child and is never added, removed,
 *   or reordered — only its visibility changes;
 * - the render layer is one stable sibling AFTER it, so neither a face swap nor
 *   a parse settling moves DOM in front of ProseMirror's live selection.
 *
 * DOM appearing and vanishing ahead of a live selection is what made the two
 * faces alternate: the observer re-read the selection across the change, the
 * new reading fell outside the fence, the render came back, and the reading
 * fell inside again.
 *
 * The face is a one-way derivation of the current selection, with no memory and
 * no test of how the caret got there, so it converges after one render whatever
 * put it in — a keystroke, a command, a peer's write mapped through Yjs, a
 * pointer answered at a boundary. This file used to claim a pointer could not
 * produce that caret. It could. Where an outside press may land is
 * `landing/press.ts`, and it is not what makes this file safe.
