/**
 * The render layer's three faces (interaction model §5.2).
 *
 * "The page never shows a diagram's syntax" is that section's rule, so a diagram
 * standing in for its own source has three ways to look and none of them is a
 * code block:
 *
 * 1. the render, whenever there is one;
 * 2. the LAST GOOD render plus the parse error, once an edit stops parsing;
 * 3. an error card naming the problem, for source that has never rendered at
 *    all — with Edit source as its one door, the same door Enter and a
 *    double-click open.
 *
 * Provider-neutral: every diagram kind wears the same three faces, and only the
 * markup inside them and the provider's name differ. Everything here changes on
 * the parser's clock, never the selection's; the node view keeps it behind a
 * stable host for exactly that reason.
 *
 * Presentation only. The door out is a callback rather than an engagement this
 * file resolves, so the diagrams module stays free of object physics and the
 * surface that owns the source pane stays the one that opens it.
