/**
 * A diagram drawn in the manuscript's own ink.
 *
 * Mermaid ships a lavender-on-white stock theme with Trebuchet labels. Dropped
 * into a chapter it reads as a screenshot from another application — the one
 * thing on the page that did not come from this product (§5.2: paper ground,
 * ink strokes, Inter labels).
 *
 * So the palette is the design tokens, read from the live document at render
 * time rather than copied into this file. Copies would be raw colors outside
 * `design-tokens`, and they would freeze: the writer's theme switch re-points
 * the same custom properties, and reading them per render is what lets a
 * diagram follow.

 * nodes are cards, strokes are the subtle ink that hairlines use, labels are
 * prose. Jade stays out of it — jade is the interactive voice, and a diagram
 * is something the writer reads, not something they press.
