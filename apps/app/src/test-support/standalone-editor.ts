/**
 * One editor over its own document: the cheap tier beside `collab-editors.ts`.
 *
 * Reach for this unless a claim names a peer. A collab pair exists for one
 * hazard — y-prosemirror rebuilding the whole ProseMirror document out from
 * under a surface — and a local test that pays for it inherits the binding's
 * mount sequence, so a change to collaboration setup breaks behavior that
 * never collaborated.
 *
 * What it owns is the setup every suite had been getting slightly differently:
 * which extensions the editor runs, that its DOM is in the page, what teardown
 * removes, and where a node is. Documents stay with the test — a lane's
 * fixture is part of what it is claiming — and so does anything genuinely
 * domain-shaped, like reading a pending upload's status off a decoration.
