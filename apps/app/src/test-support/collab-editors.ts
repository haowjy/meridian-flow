/**
 * Two editors over one shared document, for surfaces that have to survive a
 * peer's write.
 *
 * The hazard these tests exist for cannot be faked with a hand-built
 * transaction: what makes a remote write different is that y-prosemirror
 * REBUILDS the ProseMirror doc from the Yjs type and dispatches one replace
 * step over the whole document. Only a real second binding produces that, so
 * this runs a real second editor and hands its updates over the way a server
 * would.
 *
 * It also mounts them the way production does. `useMountedEditor` reconciles
 * surface options onto the running editor right after construction, and that
 * `setOptions` call is load-bearing here: it runs `view.updateState`, which is
 * where y-prosemirror decides the editor has real content and may write to the
 * shared document. A harness that skips it leaves the binding still guarding
 * its initial content, and the first edit that reduces a document to the
 * schema default — deleting its only block — is silently never sent.
