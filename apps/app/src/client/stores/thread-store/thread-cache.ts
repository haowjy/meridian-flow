/**
 * ThreadCachePort — the thin seam between the thread store's lifecycle
 * transitions and the React Query cache.
 *
 * The thread store owns per-thread turn state; the persisted thread-list and
 * snapshot projections live in React Query. The store depends on this port
 * (an interface), never on `QueryClient` directly, so the two ownerships stay
 * decoupled — that dual ownership behind a raw `queryClient` construction dep
 * was the structural root of the recurring `useThreadStore`/`QueryClient`
 * fragility.
