# Working-set client

The working-set module is the device-local restore truth for a project's recent
document routes and remembered thread. `DeviceWorkingSetStore` owns the
user-stamped persisted record; `WorkingSetSyncDriver` owns server baselines,
pending reports, hydration, and serialized sweeps.

The versioned local record and server row carry the same canonical route DTO:
stable document identity plus its current locator. Obsolete locator-only local
values and pre-migration server rows are deleted rather than decoded.

Live context removal uses `reconcileContextRoutes`: one snapshot transform removes
only identities with no surviving tab owner, repairs a same-ID locator in place, optionally promotes the resulting
active route, and clears all routes only for a genuinely empty desk. Callers must
not compose remove/promote operations for one removal transition; the sequential
driver surface is intentionally absent.

## Hydration contract

`ProjectView`, keyed by project ID, invokes hydration synchronously in its state
initializer before the prefs-gated project tree can mount. The reducer uses only
server revision lineage: unavailable stays local and cannot push, absent keeps
local, matching pending lineage keeps local, and every other row adopts server.
The account toggle guards the whole operation. Server adoption changes store
state but never navigates; restore remains owned by the existing context and
chat controllers.

Server-adopted routes are a seeding plan, not navigation instructions. The
project layer resolves each stable ID through the project-final availability
coordinator, opens it inactive, and checks that the route remains desired
immediately before the async commit. Exact project-final absence prunes by ID;
indeterminate and transport failures preserve the durable route. Server-route
restore never acquires a cold catalog or looks up a path. Device-owned local
Untitled validation remains catalog-backed and separate. One project-entry raw
operation owns seed/validation. Strict replay or a pre-live readiness
interruption adopts that operation; after it completes, Work changes use the
removal coordinator and never reopen raw tree-absence pruning.

## Suspect baseline (recovery sweep errata)

Design reference: `client-engine.md` § the sweep — the happy path stays
unconditional LWW; this rule applies only on recovery paths.

A project's in-memory baseline becomes **suspect** when:

1. a PUT fails (any error, including network),
2. the browser fires `online` after an offline period,
3. sync is re-enabled after the account toggle was off (baselines are cleared;
   entry hydration must re-establish before push — same gate, folded here).

While suspect, the sweep must not PUT. Before the next push it performs a fresh
network GET (standalone `getProjectWorkingSet`, not router-cached loader data),
then runs `planSuspectBaselineConfirmation` / `reduceWorkingSetHydration`:

- **local** (absent, or pending base matches row) → baseline confirmed; push proceeds.
- **server** (row moved past pending's base) → adopt row into the store (data
  only — no navigation, seeding, or tab changes), discard pending, confirm the
  new revision as baseline.
- **read-degraded** (GET fails) → stay suspect; backoff; retry on `online` or
  the next sweep.

Entry hydration in `ProjectView` is unchanged for UI plans, but when a project
is suspect the driver does not confirm baselines from loader results — stale
router cache cannot resurrect a trustworthy baseline mid-session.
