# @meridian/app — Architecture & Conventions

How the frontend is structured, why the seams exist, and what conventions
govern visual and interaction work.

## Project Home

The Home client boundary, feed/row layout contract, interaction ownership, and
test-specific browser constraint live with the feature in
[`src/features/project/home/.context/CONTEXT.md`](../src/features/project/home/.context/CONTEXT.md).

## Server config and auth surface

`src/server/config.ts` is the app server's config seam. It parses the
upstream-shaped runtime variables `APP_ENV` and `LOG_LEVEL` through
`src/server/runtime-config.ts`, then adds Meridian/WorkOS settings:
`WORKOS_CLIENT_ID`, `WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI`, `WORKOS_DEV_LOGIN_*`,
`WORKOS_DEV_AUTOLOGIN`, and `MERIDIAN_API_ORIGIN`. The parsed config is
server-only; isomorphic client-path helpers such as `src/client/api/ssr-api-request.ts`
must keep their guarded env reads local instead of importing `getAppServerConfig()`.

Auth is WorkOS AuthKit: the sealed `wos-session` cookie is minted by
`/api/auth/callback` (hosted AuthKit) or `/api/auth/dev-login` (dev-only password
auth). `/logout` clears the session via `signOut()`.

`isDevAutologinEnabled()` (`src/server/dev-auth.ts`) gates dev autologin; it is
false in production and requires `WORKOS_DEV_AUTOLOGIN=1` plus
`WORKOS_DEV_LOGIN_EMAIL` / `WORKOS_DEV_LOGIN_PASSWORD`.

## Dev watcher boundary

The repository `logs/` tree is generated server observability output. Vite's
`server.watch.ignored` predicate excludes that directory and its descendants so
log mirrors do not cause app reloads; it must remain boundary-aware and must
not ignore sibling paths merely sharing a prefix such as `logs-other`.

## State + transport seams

Writer-facing AI change reporting uses durable Trail evidence, receipt
Undo/Redo, and session change marks. Trail evidence and peer marks are
read-only; `DocumentSession` owns collaboration state only and does not retain
a parallel safety-notice presentation model.

Session change-mark self-suppression uses the canonical internal Meridian
`UserId` from `/api/auth/me`, matching `change_event.admittedByUserId`. WorkOS
external ids authenticate the shell but never identify collaboration records.
Two interfaces are the only paths between the visual layer and the substrate:

- **`ThreadStoreState` / `ThreadStoreActions`** (`src/client/stores/thread-store/types.ts`) —
  read vs write contracts. **Implementation:** `src/client/stores/thread-store/thread-store.tsx`
  (Zustand vanilla store, one instance per `ThreadStoreProvider`, SSR-safe).
  **Public imports:** `@/client/stores` only — do not reach into store internals from features.
  UI reads via `useThreadStore(selector)`, `useThreadTurns(threadId)`; writes via
  `useThreadActions()` only. Project Home first-message continuity lives in one
  account-scoped IndexedDB owner, not Zustand. Home stages the immutable
  Composer envelope before navigation; destination Chat atomically claims
  `ready` as `dispatching`, while a remounted `dispatching` or `ambiguous`
  record performs ledger lookup only. `ThreadRunController` joins append,
  lookup, and explicit retirement to a typed settlement boundary. Definite rejection remains durable until
  the matching shared Composer acknowledges an idempotent restoration; when a
  newer draft exists, the failed first send is prepended with a blank-line
  document separator so both writer-authored documents survive. Ambiguous admission stays
  quarantined without blind retry. If a writer changes the Home draft while
  creation or routing is pending, the immutable first message remains the
  admitted turn and the latest authored revision transfers separately into the
  destination Composer, even when that revision's text is byte-equal to the
  submitted message. The shared Composer reports a monotonic authoring revision;
  content equality is never a draft-version test.
  Continuity survives route and reload but is not an outbox: it has no timer,
  worker, polling, or blind retry. Deferred project-creation flows separately use
  `markPendingCreation`, `clearPendingCreation`, and `removeOptimisticUserTurn`;
  the last one is only rollback for a locally appended user turn that failed
  before server acknowledgement.
- **`ThreadCachePort`** (`src/client/stores/thread-store/thread-cache.ts`) —
  thin seam between thread-store lifecycle transitions and the React Query cache.
  The store depends on this port, not `QueryClient` directly — list/snapshot
  projections stay in Query; per-thread turn state stays in the store. Its
  lifecycle projector converges `actionRequired` across project thread lists,
  Home, and every matching Work feed while Favorite remains normalized separately.
- **`useRenameThread`** (`src/client/query/useRenameThread.ts`) — optimistic
  thread-title rename via `patchThreadInProjectCaches`; lives beside Query hooks
  (cache-only today, no PATCH endpoint) rather than on the thread store.
- **Thread Work binding:** `useRebindThreadWork` returns discriminated confirmed,
  reconciled, and superseded outcomes to the composer-only `ComposerWorkControl`.
  `convergeThreadWorkBinding` is the one cache-effect boundary, while
  `useThreadDurableProjections` is the one persistent transport owner. Work
  management and navigation must not call this explicit rebind path. See
  [`features/chat/.context/composer-write-mode.md`](../src/features/chat/.context/composer-write-mode.md)
  for placement, interaction ownership, and mid-thread rebind behavior.
- **Server project/thread lists + HTTP snapshots:** React Query (`client/query/` —
  `useProjectList`, `useProjectThreads`, `useWorks`, `useThreadSnapshotSync`).
  `project-invalidation` supplies project-level invalidators;
  `work-projection-cache` is the one Work-entity/binding convergence policy. Any
  thread or Work transition that can change Home also invalidates `homeFeed`.
  Terminal turns and Work rebinds enter through
  `invalidateThreadProjectionDependencies`. Snapshot synchronization applies
  history and action-required lifecycle state. Favorite commands share one
  normalized project/thread authority across Home and Work rows; Home alone
  projects the affected item between its categories without invalidation.
  `useWorks` exposes only the owned-project Work catalog. Home derives its
  initial prospective choice from the first active (then first available) catalog
  Work and sends that explicit ID; omitted root-chat creation remains the sole
  server boundary where omission and explicit null both mean no primary Work.
  Direct `/project/*` and `/chat/*` authenticated routes mount the project
  provider stack and seed the project list + `now`; the project route loader
  seeds per-project threads and works before the workspace renders, and carries
  the working-set read as an explicit `row` / `absent` / `unavailable` result.
- **Zustand (thread-store):** per-thread `turnsByThread`,
  `streamingThreadId`, pending stream metadata, snapshot reconciliation
  watermark (`snapshotNextSeqFloorByThread`). Soft-delete undo lives in the
  **project-store**, not here. See "Thread snapshot reconciliation" below.
- **`ThreadTransport`** (`src/core/transport/ThreadTransport.ts`) — the
  subscribe/cancel contract for live agent events. Runtime chat uses
  `WsThreadTransport`, which connects to `/api/threads/ws`.

These exist so adapter swaps (in-memory → Dexie, Mock → WS), protocol changes,
and reducer evolution stay contained.

## Unified live block reducer

`core/session/reduce-turn-event.ts` maps the live sequenced `AGUIEvent` stream
straight into ThreadStore actions: `ensureAssistantTurn`, `upsertAssistantBlock`,
and `patchTurnStatus`. There is no separate live-turn view model; live and
settled assistant turns are the same `Turn` rows in `turnsByThread`, with
in-flight blocks marked `status: "partial"`.

Rendering flows through `AssistantTurn` →
`partitionTurnSegments` (`features/chat/partition-turn-segments.ts`): ordered
turn blocks are split at checkpoint boundaries, and each segment renders a
default-collapsed `Thinking` fold plus its visible `ActivityBlock` frontier.
`groupDeliverySegments` normalizes tool delivery into ToolViews while preserving
image-producing tool results as image blocks. For the full Thinking/Activity
contract, see [`features/chat/.context/CONTEXT.md`](../src/features/chat/.context/CONTEXT.md).

## Wire types as protocol contract

`@meridian/contracts/protocol` defines the canonical `AGUIEvent` payload and
`SequencedAGUIEvent` transport wrapper; session entities (`Thread`, `Turn`, `Block`)
are JSON-natural string IDs and ISO timestamps from `@meridian/contracts/threads`.

Both transports emit this shape; the reducer consumes this shape.

## Client-led creation patterns

`src/lib/optimistic-project.ts` is the template for client-led writes:
client-generated UUID → navigate immediately → call `threads-api.ts` → reconcile
on response. It remains the pattern for flows whose destination can safely own
an unresolved create.

Home first send deliberately orders the boundary differently: stable client ID
→ canonical create or same-ID ambiguity reconciliation → optimistic turn and
durable continuity stage → route → destination claim. A definite stale Work or Agent refusal, whether
returned by the initial create or its guarded same-ID retry after absence
reconciliation, is identified only by the named `work_unavailable` or
`agent_not_found` code, refreshes the relevant catalog, and unlocks prospective
context repair while retaining the stable ID and immutable first text. Every
other uncertain create remains locked to that original envelope while same-ID
reconciliation continues. A canonical mismatch is never handed off; Start over
retires it before a later submission allocates a fresh ID.

Future optimistic surfaces (rename, soft-delete, undo) follow the same
shape: optimistic store update first, API call second (`threads-api.ts`),
deterministic reconcile path on response or failure.

### Thread snapshot reconciliation

Authoritative turn history enters the store through `applyThreadSnapshot`,
which reconciles server turns against local optimistic state via
`reconcileSnapshotTurns`. Two callers:

| Source | When | Code |
|--------|------|------|
| **HTTP** | Chat route mount / reload | `useThreadSnapshotSync` (Query fetch) |
| **WebSocket** | Reconnect/gap recovery | `ThreadRunController.applySnapshot` |

Do not call `applyThreadSnapshot` from `ChatView` or other view effects.
Snapshot application stays in data-sync hooks and transport recovery.

**Identity bridge.** When the user submits a message, the client creates an
optimistic turn with a `turn_local_*` ID. The POST /messages response is the
identity bridge: `acknowledgeUserTurn` rewrites the local row to the
canonical server ID. The response also carries `snapshotFloorNextSeq` — the
minimum snapshot `nextSeq` that reflects the append (the server computes
head+1; the client stores it directly, no arithmetic). Acknowledgement raises
the thread's stored snapshot floor to it, so a stale snapshot cannot remove
the rewritten row while the projector catches up.

**Monotonic sequence guard.** `applyThreadSnapshot` requires a
`nextSeq` option (the server-assigned journal sequence for the snapshot).
The store tracks `snapshotNextSeqFloorByThread` and rejects
any snapshot whose `nextSeq` is strictly less than the stored value
(BigInt comparison for journal sequences beyond Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).
Both HTTP snapshot callers must pass `nextSeq`. An unsequenced caller
(no `nextSeq`) is treated as authoritative and always applies -- omitting
`nextSeq` is intentional only for the handoff/pending-creation path.

## Authenticated layout shell

`src/routes/__root.tsx` owns AuthKit and renders the route outlet directly.
The authenticated route's `AccountFeatureComposition` constructs its account
feature lifetime synchronously, so its providers and descendants render on the
first pass. An actual A-to-B account replacement synchronously fences the old
lifetime and finishes its staged teardown before constructing B; only that
replacement interval withholds descendants. The authenticated browser effect
rehydrates the device Context desk after the shell is visible. Local persistence
reconciliation never projects an account-preparation screen or gates initial
rendering.

`src/routes/_authenticated.tsx` mounts one unconditional route composition for
every authenticated route (`AppQueryProvider` → `AccountFeatureComposition` →
`DraftApplyRecoveryProvider` → `ProjectStoreProvider` → `ThreadStoreProvider` →
`TransportProvider` → `MeridianCopilotProvider`). No
pathname-based provider gating — conditional light↔workspace branches previously
dropped `ThreadStoreProvider` during transitions.

**Settings overlay:** `?settings=<section>` is layout-owned (`validateSearch` on
`/_authenticated`) so the settings dialog is URL-addressable from any authenticated
route without changing path. See `features/account/SettingsDialog.tsx`.

## Project screen routing

`SCREENS` (`features/project/shell/screens.ts`) is the single source of
route-valid primary destinations: **home, work, chat, context** (Import removed).
Settings and phone Results are auxiliary routed surfaces (`?settings=`,
`?results=`), not drawer/sidebar destinations.

`src/routes/_authenticated/project/$projectId.tsx` owns the workspace search
params (`?screen=`, `?thread=`, `?work=`, `?scheme=`, `?folder=`, `?path=`, `?results`) and
is the single source of screen/thread/context ownership. `ProjectView` and its
children are controlled — they never set the URL directly, only call the route's
handlers. Direct `/chat/$threadId` renders the independent chat view inside the
same provider stack.

The dedicated Work screen presents Active Work first and keeps Archived Work in a
default-collapsed disclosure. Work management has no project-wide selection state;
collection reads and actions never read, resolve, repair, or change the internal
thread creation, and never implicitly change a thread binding. The Work-list
payload is catalog-only; omitted or null root creation remains explicitly no-Work.
Home and Work each own exactly one screen-level `app-scroll`; neither screen
adds a nested scroll owner. Their bodies share `project-screen-column`, whose
named inline-size container controls collection columns independently of the
viewport.

Ownership rules:

- **`?screen=` wins; a bare `?thread=` (no screen) implies `chat`.** The
  Context/KB, extensions, and home screens are therefore reachable *with threads
  present* — a thread no longer forces the chat screen.
- **`onSelectThread` is screen-changing** (sets `screen: undefined` + `thread`,
  i.e. navigate to chat); **`onSelectDockThread` is screen-preserving** (patches
  only `thread`). The persistent `ChatDockPanel` (right-hand dock beside non-chat
  screens) uses the dock handler so its thread switcher swaps the conversation
  without stealing `?screen=` from the KB/file view.
- **The dock's fallback thread is display-only.** When no valid `?thread=` is set,
  the dock shows the first primary thread in its selector but **must not** write
  that fallback into the route — non-chat screens own `?screen=`, so forcing the
  fallback into the URL would flip the screen to chat.
- **Stale/invalid params are normalized at the route.** A `?thread=` that isn't in
  the loaded thread set is stripped via a `replace` navigation once threads load;
  `validateSearch` rejects `folder`/`path` supplied without a `scheme` (no
  contradictory KB state from hand-typed/stale URLs). Explicit Work IDs use the
  contracts-owned UUID grammar: malformed values return immediately to the Work
  collection, uppercase values canonicalize, and a valid missing ID returns only
  after the all-status Work catalog succeeds. Loading/error preserves the URL,
  and every Work normalization compares its original `screen/work` pair before
  replacing so stale validation cannot overwrite newer navigation. Switching
  screens drops the subordinate params of the screen left behind.

## Visual conventions — tonal manuscript shell

Agent entry point: [DESIGN.md](../../../DESIGN.md) (repo-root design doc; YAML snapshot).
This section is the implementation contract (tiers, overflow chain, discipline test).

The shell follows the settled **earthen value ladder** — one grey-gold family
separated by lightness: shelf `oklch(0.91 0.012 84)` (pressed
`oklch(0.86 0.014 84)`), one chrome field `oklch(0.945 0.012 84)` shared
pixel-identically by tab band and dock, and warm paper `oklch(0.977 0.007 95)`
as the brightest page. Light mode
uses one black ink `oklch(0.24 0.009 100)` throughout. Jade is action-only;
cinnabar is a scarce seal. The visual tokens live in
`packages/design-tokens/src/ink-jade.css`.

**Skin, not shell.** The palette, typography, accent semantics, brand mark, and
login hero are a skin. Sidebar/composer structure and interaction patterns stay
stable; token changes must not alter layout or behavior.

### Token hierarchy

**Tier 1 — semantic tokens (`@meridian/design-tokens/ink-jade.css`).**
Shared palette imported into `globals.css` as Tailwind v4 `@theme` variables,
consumed everywhere as classes (`bg-card`, `shadow-card`, `text-headline-hero`)
or direct `var(--color-*)` CSS references. Categories:

- **Three-tone ladder:** shelf (rail — chrome one shade darker), sidebar (tab band ≡ dock chrome), background (warm paper page — brightest), card (local lifted fields/menus)
- **Ink and accents:** foreground (one black ink), primary/jade-text (actions, links, focus), cinnabar (scarce seal only), muted and ink hierarchy roles
- **Composer:** manuscript-tone `composer-surface` plus `composer-border`; it does not borrow chrome or action color
- **Borders:** `border`, `border-subtle`, `border-focus` — in-pane controls and hairlines only; shell-region separation is tonal, with no seam borders
- **Shadows:** `shadow-card`, `shadow-hero`, `shadow-button`, `shadow-rail-left`
- **Atmosphere:** `dock-airlight` lifts the dock floor; the shelf stays flat so scrolled navigation keeps constant contrast
- **Type scale:** `text-headline-hero`, `text-headline-section`, `text-body`,
  `text-compact` / `text-caption` (secondary-prose roles — bundle a relaxed
  reading line-height), `text-sm` / `text-xs` (UI-control sizes),
  `text-meta` (dense metadata). Custom `--text-*` size tokens must be registered
  in `cn()`'s font-size group (`lib/utils.ts`) or tailwind-merge silently drops
  them next to a `text-<color>`.
- **Radii:** explicit `--radius-sm` / `--radius-md` / `--radius-lg` / `--radius-xl` values where component geometry needs distinct values
- **Status colors:** `status-streaming`, `destructive` (distinct from cinnabar)

Contrast guardrails: black ink is about 12.6:1 on the flat shelf and 10.7:1 on
its pressed step; muted and hint roles are 6.5:1. The
[Earthen Value Ladder decision](https://github.com/haowjy/meridian-flow-docs/blob/main/kb/decisions/earthen-value-ladder-shell.md)
owns the deeper rationale, measurements, and rejected directions.

When a new visual concept appears in ≥2 places, it becomes a Tier 1 token. New
shared tokens land in `packages/design-tokens/src/ink-jade.css` (or project-only
`@theme` in `globals.css` when app-specific); only then are they consumed.

**Tier 2 — `@utility` primitives (also in `globals.css`).** Composite patterns
that bundle multiple tokens into a reusable class. Today's primitives:

- `surface-card` — the rounded card surface
- `streaming-dot` — live indicator
- `app-frame` — viewport-locked shell (`h-svh max-h-svh overflow-hidden`); one screen, no page scroll
- `app-scroll` — designated vertical scroll region inside `app-frame`
- `main-pane` — flex shrink + horizontal clip (`min-w-0 max-w-full overflow-x-hidden`); use on shell inset, chat surface, scroll region — **not** on turn leaves
- `chat-column` — chat conversation column (`max-w-chat-column`, horizontal padding)
- `home-column` — home page column (`max-w-home`, vertical padding; grid `li` shrink)
- `chat-scroll-fade-bottom` — bottom-edge mask on the chat scrollport (`--chat-scroll-fade-size`, scrollbar gap tokens); fades messages behind the pinned composer, not an overlay scrim
- `user-turn` / `user-message-bubble` — right-aligned user prompt chrome
- `prose-tokens` — Streamdown/markdown wrapper (typography + code/table overflow).
  Font size is `calc(1rem * var(--text-scale))`; all inner element sizes
  (headings, code, tables) are `em` so the whole tree rides the text-size
  preference. Element styling for markdown lives here, not in Streamdown
  component overrides — Streamdown's baked fixed-rem utilities (`text-sm` on
  inline code / table cells) must be overridden by a declaration, or they pin
  that element off-scale.
- `text-tier-chat` — remaps `--text-scale` to `--text-scale-chat` for a
  subtree: chat reads **one preference stop below the manuscript** (md→sm,
  sm→xs, lg→md). Mounted once on `ChatSurface`; the manuscript editor rides
  the full scale. Conversation is working material; the manuscript is the
  artifact. Tiers are DOM inheritance: portaled overlays escape to manuscript
  scale by design.
- `text-tier-compact` — the dense meta voice for markdown (tool output,
  reasoning): parameterizes `prose-tokens` (`--text-scale`, `--prose-leading`,
  `--prose-color`) instead of stacking a second font-size utility, so no two
  classes compete for the same property by source order. Fixed size (does not
  ride the reading preference).

When a className composition repeats in ≥2 places, promote it to a primitive.
Thin React wrappers (`ChatColumn`, `HomeColumn`) only pin a utility name — no
extra layout logic.

### Horizontal overflow (flex shrink chain)

Page-level horizontal scroll is prevented by a **boundary chain**, not per-turn
`min-w-0` classes:

1. `html` / `body` — locked height, `overflow: hidden`
2. `app-frame` — viewport shell (`AppShell`, bare-view root, `SidebarProvider`)
3. `app-scroll` — designated vertical scroll regions inside the frame
4. `AppShell` → `SidebarInset` — `main-pane`
5. `ChatSurface` root + scroll region — `main-pane`
6. `chat-column` / `home-column` — include `main-pane`
7. `prose-tokens` — `break-words`; `pre` / table wrapper scroll inside the column
8. `user-turn` — `max-w-[95%]` on the bubble column

Cross-repo OSS comparison for shell/scroll boundaries:
[source-app-shell-patterns.md](source-app-shell-patterns.md).

**Exceptions (keep `min-w-0` on the truncating flex child only):** `disclosure-trigger`,
ProcessDisclosure / process-fold summary rows, sidebar `ThreadRow` rename field,
`ErrorBlock` / `ImageBlock` flex rows.

**Tier 3 — Tailwind base scale (in TSX).** Component-internal spacing only.
`gap-2`, `p-3`, `mb-4`, `space-y-1`. Use the base scale, never arbitrary
pixels. Component-specific *geometry* (a particular avatar size, a specific
rounded corner) is acceptable inline.

### Spacing

Spacing is contextual and resists full centralization:

- **Centralize (Tier 1)** when the value defines *cross-component rhythm* —
  page gutter, sidebar width, `--container-chat-column` (48rem), `--container-home`
  (45rem), composer footer fade, section gap. Two components need to agree on the value.
- **Use the Tailwind scale (Tier 3)** for *component-internal* spacing —
  internal padding, gap between sibling elements, button padding. The
  component owns the value.
- **Magic pixels are a smell.** If a value isn't in the Tailwind scale, it's
  either (a) Tier 1 rhythm that needs promoting, or (b) you should round to
  the nearest scale step.

Dropdown row geometry is shared by `components/ui/dropdown-presentation.ts`.
Row-bearing regions add vertical breathing only; `dropdownRowVariants` alone
owns the horizontal text gutter and square, full-bleed state paint. Keyboard
focus uses block-edge rules and the theme-specific semantic dropdown focus
indicator, whose contrast is protected against every shared row fill, not a
four-sided inset halo. It remains visible inside popup clipping without reading
as another card. Search
fields, headings, and state copy add their own local gutters. This keeps
selected, hover, and focus boundaries edge-attached across menus, selects,
pickers, composer navigation, and the thread switcher.

### Typography

Three fonts via `@theme`: `--font-heading` → Cormorant Garamond (display),
`--font-prose` → Noto Serif (editor/turns/markdown), `--font-sans` → Inter (UI
chrome). Loaded via Google Fonts in the app root layout. Headline weight/size
comes from `text-headline-*` tokens — components consume token classes, not font
family names directly.

### UI themes and dark mode

Theme switching is token-contained: `@meridian/design-tokens/themes.css`
holds `:root[data-ui-theme="<name>"]` blocks (currently `dark`) that
re-point the same token names; the default light palette is the absence of
the attribute. The device-local preference lives in `src/lib/ui-theme.ts`
(localStorage + pre-paint boot script in `__root.tsx`, mirroring text
size) and is switched from Settings → Preferences. Tailwind's `dark:`
variant keys off the same attribute (see `globals.css`) — never a `.dark`
class.

## i18n

Every user-facing string flows through Lingui macros. Use `<Trans>` for static
text, `` t`...` `` for dynamic text, and ICU `plural`/`select` for
plurals/branching. Locale resolution is centralized in `src/lib/i18n.ts`. To add
a locale: drop a `.po` file in `src/locales/<code>/`, add the code to
`lingui.config.ts` + the `CATALOGS` map.

## Accessibility (vocabulary to follow as it lands)

A11y primitives should be centralized the same way visual tokens are:

- **Focus rings:** one `focus-ring` utility (consuming `--border-focus`) that
  every interactive component uses.
- **Visually hidden text:** a `visually-hidden` utility (or shadcn's
  `<VisuallyHidden>`) for screen-reader-only content.
- **Live regions:** one shared `aria-live="polite"` region near `<body>`, fed
  by a `useAnnouncement()` hook. Streaming text, tool progress, status
  changes route through it.
- **Semantic HTML first:** `<nav>` / `<main>` / `<aside>` / heading hierarchy.
  ARIA augments, doesn't replace.
- **Keyboard contracts:** centralize shortcuts in one registry; don't sprinkle
  `onKeyDown` handlers across components.
- **Pointer cursor on anything actionable**, which shadcn and Tailwind v4 do
  not do — their reset leaves buttons on the arrow. Human ruling: this app is
  dense with quiet controls, and a writer should not have to click to learn
  what was clickable. One base-layer rule in `src/styles/globals.css` covers
  buttons, `[role="button"]`, `a[href]` and `summary`, minus anything disabled
  by attribute or by `aria-disabled`; components add no cursor utility of their
  own. Manuscript links are the deliberate exception — inside `.ProseMirror` a
  link is text under the caret. **A shadcn refresh will try to take this back;
  it is a divergence we keep.**

## Motion (forward-looking)

When motion vocabulary is needed, follow the same pattern: define
`--motion-fast` / `--motion-normal` / `--motion-deliberate` durations and a
small easing scale in `globals.css`, consume via tokens in TSX.

## Discipline test

Before merging a change that touches visuals: grep the touched files for
`#`-hex colors, `rgba(...)`, `rounded-[N]`, `text-[N]px`, `gap-[N]px`,
`mt-[N]px`. Each one is either justified (genuinely surface-specific
geometry) or it's a token that wants promoting.

UI tests assert a behavior or semantic seam—roles, names, state, callback
outcomes, accessible errors, or a public component boundary—not Tailwind
styling vocabulary. Browser-measure real layout and hit boxes; JSDOM cannot
establish geometry.

## Dev limitations (pilot)

- Thread event log is in-memory in `apps/server`. Agent events lost on `apps/server` restart. Swap the adapter there without touching this app.
- Dev API proxy (`apiHttpDevProxyPlugin`) skips WebSocket upgrades (those go via Vite `server.proxy`). Its explicit route-owner inventory keeps `/api/auth/callback` and `/api/auth/dev-login` in TanStack Start while forwarding the server-owned auth family, including `/api/auth/me`, to `apps/server`.

## E2E document fixtures

E2E fixtures create document content through the authenticated context HTTP API.
They may seed the relational project, Work, thread, and context-source shell in
SQL, but never write `documents.markdown_projection` or collaboration tables.
Yjs is the content authority, while `markdown_projection` is only a derived
cache; a document row without canonical Yjs state is treated by
`ensureDocument` as an empty checkpoint. Teardown deletes the owning context
sources and relies on their document and collaboration cascades.
