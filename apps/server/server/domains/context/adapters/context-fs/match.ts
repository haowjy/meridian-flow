/**
 * Per-document search matching: the passages a query hit, how to navigate back
 * to them, and how often the document holds it. Shared by the in-memory and
 * drizzle context stores so both report search hits identically.
 *
 * **A document reports several passages, not one.** One hit per document
 * under-reports what the model received and leaves the writer's expand showing
 * a single sentence for a chapter that mentions the name five times. The list
 * is capped because a search result is a way in, not the document itself; the
 * count beside it stays honest about everything the cap left out.
 *
 * The unit of the scan is a **block**, not a text line. Manuscript documents
 * arrive as hashlines (`hash|body`), where one entry is one block and a
 * multi-line block carries its own newlines; every other scheme arrives as
 * plain markdown lines, where the two coincide. Scanning per entry is what
 * lets a hit carry the block hash the writer's editor navigates to, and it
 * keeps the query away from the hash itself — a hash is hex, and hex spells
 * words often enough to over-report a count.
 *
 * **The hash leaves through its own field, never inside the excerpt.** A
 * passage carries the block's body; addressing and prose are separate values,
 * so nothing downstream has to know the hashline format to show a sentence to
 * a writer. Plain schemes are unaffected: their body is the whole entry.
