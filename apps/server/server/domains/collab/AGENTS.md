# domains/collab — server-side branch collaboration

This domain composes `@meridian/agent-edit` with Meridian persistence and
Hocuspocus transport. It owns durable live and branch Yjs infrastructure, not
editor UI or transport-shell policy.

## Mental model

- Live documents, per-thread peers, and per-Work review drafts are real Y.Docs.
  Sync propagates between them; journals are durable and runtime state is
  reconstructible.
- A Work draft is shared by every thread editing the same document in that Work.
  Apply publishes its whole current branch; Discard operates on server-vended
  review classes rather than client-reconstructed turns.
- Each live document has a durable authority head whose identity, generation,
  and admission sequence fence every connection and mutation.
- `@meridian/agent-edit` owns schema-safe mutation and reversal planning. This
  domain owns authorization, persistence, coordination, settlement, and trail
  projection around that core.

## Decision-changing rules

- Keep dependencies one-way: collab adapters import `@meridian/agent-edit`; the
  package must not import server code.
- Admit novel writer content durably before Yjs apply, broadcast, or ack. Route
  live and branch writes through their coordinator-owned admission seams.
- Reject writer updates with reserved client IDs or mutations in the reserved
  provenance namespace before durable append or Yjs apply.
- Yjs merge is trusted. Destructive effects inform marks and receipts but never
  veto an otherwise valid merge; receipt Undo/Redo remains reversal authority.
- Branch Y.Docs use `gc: false`; reversal dependency checks require their full
  struct history.
- Any content apply after an `await` must obey the documented WebSocket
  concurrency fence. Do not assume a coordinator lock excludes socket writes.
- Model reads and writes go through the thread-peer pool with a caller-computed
  destination; nothing in collab decides live versus draft from a thread's
  mode. Scratch and uploads are never drafted, and `ensureWorkDraftBranch`
  throws if asked to.
- A reply saves once: every document it wrote, live or drafted, in one
  transaction. Live text reaches open editors only after commit.
- Derive live read models from a journal-locked durable cut, never a warm room
  paired with a database watermark. The recovery sweep owns freshness; triggers
  only reduce latency. Push derivation joins its completion transaction.
- Route schema-aware content reads, seeds, and writes through
  `domain/markdown-document.ts`.
- Build the markup codec once, in `domain/agent-edit-runtime.ts`, where the
  composition root injects the project asset resolver. A second `mdxCodec(...)`
  silently loses that index.
