## Draft preview fails on empty paragraphs

The draft-preview endpoint returns HTTP 500 when a draft contains an empty
paragraph: `Cannot anchor text offset in block <id> (paragraph) without text`.
Reproduce at the draft-preview anchoring seam and make empty text blocks a
supported preview input.

## Code files become a display lens; cross-schema rename becomes a metadata flip

The client mounts a constrained schema for code with exactly one `code_block`
(`config.ts` `CodeDocument`), and `markdown-document.ts` serializes code
verbatim from block 0 only. Document ↔ code renames return typed
`invalid_operation` (`context-fs.law` tests) because remounting the
other schema against existing content could let ProseMirror normalization
delete it.

The desired end state in [#212](https://github.com/haowjy/meridian-flow/issues/212)
uses one schema everywhere. Code becomes presentation, input policy, and
line-oriented verbatim serialization rather than a mounted schema. Disable
prose affordances through commands, paste, and transaction filters, not schema
node removal; then md ↔ py rename is a metadata flip and `CodeDocument` plus the
block-0 serializer are deleted.

**Affected paths:** app editor `config.ts`, collab
`domain/markdown-document.ts`, context filetype moves, and their schema and
round-trip tests.
