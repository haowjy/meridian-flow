/**
 * Wire contract for internal document-link resolution.
 *
 * Three spellings, one family (interaction model §5.5): a wikilink title, a
 * `manuscript://` or `work://` URI, and a path relative to the document that
 * holds the link. The editor classifies an href into one of these and the
 * server resolves it to a project document; `null` back is the normal
 * unresolved state, not an error, because serial writers link chapters before
 * they write them.
 *
 * External links never appear here. They are the client's own business and
 * need no server round trip.
