# Testing Principles

Testing buys confidence that a change does what it claims and does not break what it didn't touch. Coverage percentages, mock counts, and test totals are instruments, not goals.

## Test for Risk, Not Completeness

Match test effort to risk, not coverage targets. High-risk areas (data integrity, auth, payment, integration boundaries): comprehensive coverage with edge cases and error conditions. Low-risk areas (formatting, simple CRUD): manual smoke check or nothing.

## Tier Selection

- **Pure logic, no I/O?** Unit test. Fast, exhaustive edge cases, no boundaries to fake.
- **Components composing, external systems fakeable?** Integration test. Medium speed, fakes at process/network boundaries.
- **Real runtime behavior matters?** Manual smoke / e2e. Real processes, real APIs, closest to users.

Modern practice leans integration-heavy ("Testing Trophy"): integration tests offer the best ROI because they test behavior the way users invoke it. Unit tests are for pure logic. Automated E2E is for critical user journeys only.

When tier choice is unclear, improve the manual smoke instructions first. Promote to automated tests only when the risk is hard to verify manually and the test protects a named contract cheaply.

See `resources/tier-judgment.md` for the decision diagram.

## Test Behavior, Not Implementation

Assert on outcomes (return values, state changes, side effects), not implementation paths. Tests that verify private state or mock call counts break on correct refactoring. If tests break on a refactor that doesn't change behavior, they're testing the wrong thing.

A regression test must construct the pre-fix failing shape. Verify it would fail against the old code, by running it or reasoning through the exact structure. Tests that byte-copy rows, clone fresh clients, or manually inject the value under test are decorative. For every new conditional, ask whether the predicate can ever fire, then build that shape.

For features entered through `orchestrator → tool → domain`, keep one fixture that drives that real entry point with a mock model and real DB. Domain-facade tests cannot catch wiring bugs.

Mocks honor provider identity contracts. Tool calls, response ids, and similar provider ids should be unique and scoped like the real provider; test collision shapes deliberately instead of relying on unrealistic mock accidents.

## Architecture Enables Testing

Functional core / imperative shell: push decisions into pure functions, push I/O to the edges, test the core exhaustively and the shell shallowly. Code that's hard to test usually has a structural problem. Heavy mocking is a smell about the architecture, not about testing.

See `resources/functional-core.md`.

## Hermetic by Default

No external network calls, no shared state between tests, deterministic inputs. Each test is self-contained with its own setup and teardown.

## DAMP Over DRY

Test code should be descriptive and readable in isolation, not aggressively DRY. Shared setup code becomes a hidden dependency that breaks tests in unexpected ways.

## LLM-Generated Test Caveats

LLM-generated tests tend to verify what's already working rather than probe failure modes. Explicitly target: boundary conditions, error paths, adversarial inputs. Generate, execute, analyze gaps, regenerate iteratively.
