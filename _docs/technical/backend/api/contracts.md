# API Contracts & Validation Rules

## Project Operations

### List Projects (GET /api/projects)

- Returns all projects for the authenticated user
- Ordered by `updated_at DESC` (most recently updated first)
- Returns empty array `[]` if user has no projects

**Response:** Array of Project objects

### Create Project (POST /api/projects)

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "name": "My New Project"
}
```

**Validation:**
- Name required (cannot be empty after trimming)
- Max length: 255 characters (see `config.MaxProjectNameLength`)
- Name is trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace

**Response:** Created Project object with generated `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`

### Get Project (GET /api/projects/:id)

- Returns single project by ID
- Returns 404 if project not found or doesn't belong to user

**Response:** Project object

### Update Project (PATCH /api/projects/:id)

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "name": "Updated Project Name"
}
```

**Validation:**
- Same rules as Create Project
- Updates `updated_at` timestamp automatically

**Response:** Updated Project object

### Delete Project (DELETE /api/projects/:id)

- Deletes project if it has no documents
- Returns 409 Conflict if project contains documents (FK constraint with `ON DELETE RESTRICT`)
- Returns 404 if project not found
- Returns 204 No Content on success

**Safety:** User must delete all documents before deleting project (prevents accidental data loss)

### Get Project Tree (GET /api/projects/:id/tree)

- Returns the nested folder/document tree for a project
- Metadata only (no document content)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "folders": [
    {
      "id": "folder-uuid",
      "project_id": "project-uuid",
      "name": "Characters",
      "folder_id": null,
      "created_at": "2025-11-02T10:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-11-02T10:00:00Z",
      "folders": [
        {
          "id": "subfolder-uuid",
          "project_id": "project-uuid",
          "name": "Heroes",
          "folder_id": "folder-uuid",
          "created_at": "2025-11-02T10:05:00Z",
          "updated_at": "2025-11-02T10:05:00Z",
          "folders": [],
          "documents": []
        }
      ],
      "documents": [
        {
          "id": "doc-uuid",
          "name": "Aria Moonwhisper",
          "project_id": "project-uuid",
          "folder_id": "folder-uuid",
          "extension": ".md",
          "updated_at": "2025-11-02T12:03:45Z"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": "root-doc-uuid",
      "name": "Quick Notes",
      "project_id": "project-uuid",
      "folder_id": null,
      "extension": ".md",
      "updated_at": "2025-11-02T11:47:12Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Notes:
- Documents include `extension` but omit `content` (fetch content via `GET /api/documents/:id`).
- Designed for fast navigation; individual document content is fetched via `GET /api/documents/:id`.

## Folder Operations

### Create Folder (POST /api/folders)

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "project_id": "uuid",
  "name": "Folder Name",
  "folder_id": ""  // Empty string for root level (or omit/null)
}
```

**Unix-style Path Notation (NEW):**

The `name` field now supports Unix-style path notation for creating nested folder hierarchies in a single request:

**Examples:**
```json
// Relative path - creates nested folders relative to folder_id
{
  "name": "Characters/Villains",
  "folder_id": null
}
// Creates: Characters (parent) -> Villains (child)

// Absolute path - ignores folder_id, creates from root
{
  "name": "/Magic/Spells",
  "folder_id": "some-folder-id"
}
// Creates: Magic (root) -> Spells (child), folder_id is ignored
```

**Path Notation Rules:**
- **Relative paths** (`a/b/c`): Creates folders relative to `folder_id` (or root if `folder_id` is null/omitted)
- **Absolute paths** (`/a/b/c`): Leading `/` means start from project root, ignoring `folder_id`
- **Auto-creation**: Intermediate folders are created automatically if they don't exist (idempotent)
- **Transaction**: All folders created atomically - if any fails, entire operation is rolled back
- **Final segment**: The last segment becomes the actual folder name

**Path Validation (Strict):**
- ❌ No consecutive slashes: `a//b` -> 400 error
- ❌ No trailing slashes: `a/` -> 400 error
- ❌ No empty segments
- ✅ Each segment must be valid folder name (alphanumeric, spaces, hyphens, underscores)
- ✅ Each segment length <= `config.MaxFolderNameLength`

**Root-level convention:**
- Use `""` (empty string), `null`, or omit `folder_id` for root-level folders
- All three are equivalent and create a folder at the project root

### Update Folder (PATCH /api/folders/:id)

- Moving to root uses an empty string for the parent identifier (not null), to disambiguate from omitted fields.
- Renaming and moving can be performed independently or combined in a single request.

Rationale: distinguishing an explicit move to root from "no change" avoids ambiguity in request payloads.

**Request Body:**
- `project_id` (string, required): Project ID
- `name` (string, optional): New folder name
- `folder_id` (string, optional): New parent folder ID (empty string for root)

**Validation:**
- At least one field (`name` or `folder_id`) must be provided
- Simple folder names cannot contain `/` (regex: `^[^/]+$`)
- Path notation only supported in CREATE operations, not UPDATE
- Max length: See `config.MaxFolderNameLength`
- Cannot create circular references (validated server-side)

**Implementation:** Details omitted here; behavior is defined by the validation and response rules below.

## Import Operations

### Merge Import (POST /api/import)

Bulk import documents from zip file(s) in merge mode. Existing documents are updated, new ones are created.

**Request:**
- Method: POST
- Content-Type: multipart/form-data
- Field name: `files` (supports multiple zip files)
- Each zip file should contain markdown (`.md`) files organized in folders

**Behavior:**
- Creates folders automatically based on file paths
- Updates existing documents (same name + folder)
- Creates new documents if they don't exist
- Processes multiple zip files in single request

**Name Sanitization:**
- Document names containing `/` are automatically sanitized to `-` during import
- Prevents filesystem path confusion (document names follow same rules as folder names)
- Example: `"Hero/Villain"` (from filename) becomes `"Hero-Villain"`
- Ensures imported documents meet validation rules

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "summary": {
    "created": 5,
    "updated": 2,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 1,
    "total_files": 8
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "file": "invalid.txt",
      "error": "file is not a zip file"
    }
  ],
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": "doc-uuid",
      "path": "Characters/Heroes/Aria",
      "name": "Aria",
      "action": "created"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Replace Import (POST /api/import/replace)

Bulk import documents from zip file(s) in replace mode. **Deletes all existing documents** in the project first, then imports.

**Request:** Same format as Merge Import

**Behavior:**
1. Deletes ALL documents in the project
2. Deletes ALL folders in the project
3. Imports all documents from zip file(s)
4. Creates folder structure from file paths

**Warning:** This is a destructive operation. All existing content will be permanently deleted before import.

**Response:** Same format as Merge Import

**Use Cases:**
- Merge Import: Sync changes, add new content
- Replace Import: Full project restore from backup, complete content refresh

## Document Operations

### Identifier Resolution

Projects and documents support different identifier types:

| Resource | Endpoint Pattern | UUID | Slug |
|----------|-----------------|------|------|
| Project | `/api/projects/:id` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Document | `/api/documents/:id` | ✅ | ❌ |

**Why documents only support UUIDs directly:**
Documents are identified by their project-relative path, which requires project context.
Standalone document endpoints like `/api/documents/:id` only accept UUIDs.

**Access patterns:**
- **Projects**: Use UUID or slug in `/api/projects/:id`
- **Documents**: Use UUID in `/api/documents/:id`, or use tree endpoint with project context

**Document Path Format:**
Documents use project-relative paths for URL routing:
- Root documents: `readme`, `chapter-1`
- Nested documents: `characters/heroes/aria`, `locations/cities/stormhaven`

Paths are derived from folder structure and document names. Frontend uses splat routes
to capture the full path and resolves to UUID via the tree store.

### Create Document (POST /api/documents)

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "project_id": "uuid",
  "name": "Document Name",
  "content": "Markdown content",
  "folder_id": "",        // Empty string for root level (or omit/null)
  "folder_path": "Path"   // Alternative: use folder path instead
}
```

**Unix-style Path Notation in `name` Field (NEW):**

Similar to folders, the `name` field now supports Unix-style path notation for creating documents with auto-created folder hierarchies:

**Examples:**
```json
// Relative path - creates folders and document relative to folder_id
{
  "name": "Locations/Cities/Stormhaven",
  "folder_id": null,
  "content": "# Stormhaven\n\nA coastal city..."
}
// Creates: Locations -> Cities -> Document "Stormhaven"

// Absolute path - ignores folder_id, creates from root
{
  "name": "/Worldbuilding/timeline",
  "folder_id": "some-folder-id",
  "content": "# Timeline\n\nHistory..."
}
// Creates: Worldbuilding (root) -> Document "timeline", folder_id is ignored
```

**Path Notation Rules:**
- **Relative paths** (`a/b/doc`): Creates folders relative to `folder_id` (or root if `folder_id` is null/omitted)
- **Absolute paths** (`/a/b/doc`): Leading `/` means start from project root, ignoring `folder_id`
- **Auto-creation**: Intermediate folders are created automatically (idempotent)
- **Transaction**: All folders and document created atomically
- **Final segment**: The last segment becomes the document name
- **Priority**: If `name` contains path notation, it overrides both `folder_id` and `folder_path`

**Path Validation (Strict):**
- Same strict rules as folder path notation
- ❌ No consecutive slashes, trailing slashes, or empty segments
- ✅ Each segment (except final) must be valid folder name
- ✅ Final segment must be valid document name

**Root-level convention:**
- Use `""` (empty string), `null`, or omit `folder_id`/`folder_path` for root-level documents
- All three are equivalent and create a document at the project root
- **Resolution priority** (when `name` has NO path notation):
  1. `folder_id` (direct folder reference) - frontend optimization
  2. `folder_path` (legacy path resolution) - external AI/import

### Update Document (PATCH /api/documents/:id)

- Same patterns as folders, but use `folder_id` for moves. Moving to root uses an empty string.
- Supports rename, move, and content updates—these can be combined.
- Content format is Markdown. Requests that update content provide a `content` field; responses include `content`.
- **Path notation NOT supported in UPDATE** - only in CREATE operations

**Request Body:**
- `project_id` (string, required): Project ID
- `name` (string, optional): New document name
- `folder_id` (string, optional): New parent folder ID (empty string for root)
- `content` (string, optional): New content (Markdown)

**Validation:**
- Simple document names **cannot contain** `/` (filesystem semantics, regex: `^[^/]+$`)
- Path notation only supported in CREATE operations, not UPDATE
- Names are automatically trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace
- Max length: See `config.MaxDocumentNameLength`

**Rationale:** Documents follow filesystem naming conventions. Use folder structure for hierarchy, not slashes in document names.

**Content format:**
- Canonical content stored and emitted by the API is Markdown.
- The frontend editor uses a different internal representation and converts to/from Markdown at the boundary.
- Word count and similar derived fields are computed from Markdown.

### Search Documents (GET /api/documents/search)

Full-text search across documents with multi-field support and weighted ranking.

**Query Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `query` | String | Yes | - | Search query string |
| `project_id` | UUID | No | - | Scope to specific project (empty = search all projects) |
| `fields` | String | No | `name,content` | Comma-separated fields to search (`name`, `content`) |
| `limit` | Integer | No | 20 | Results per page (max 100) |
| `offset` | Integer | No | 0 | Pagination offset |
| `language` | String | No | `english` | FTS language config (e.g., `spanish`, `french`) |
| `folder_id` | UUID | No | - | Filter by specific folder |

**Field Weighting:**
- `name` matches: 2.0x multiplier (title matches ranked higher)
- `content` matches: 1.0x multiplier (normal weight)
- Multi-field searches combine scores additively

**Response:**
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "document": {
        "id": "doc-uuid",
        "project_id": "project-uuid",
        "folder_id": "folder-uuid",
        "name": "Dragon Lore",
        "extension": ".md",
        "content": "# Dragon Lore\n\nDragons are ancient...",
        "metadata": {
          "markdown": { "wordCount": 312 }
        },
        "path": "World Building/Creatures/Dragon Lore",
        "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
        "updated_at": "2025-01-15T10:05:00Z"
      },
      "score": 0.0845,
      "metadata": {
        "rank_method": "ts_rank",
        "language": "english"
      }
    }
  ],
  "total_count": 42,
  "has_more": true,
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 20,
  "strategy": "fulltext"
}
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Basic search (defaults: both fields, 20 results)
GET /api/documents/search?query=dragon

# Search specific project
GET /api/documents/search?query=battle+scene&project_id=uuid

# Search only document names/titles
GET /api/documents/search?query=chapter&fields=name

# Search both fields explicitly
GET /api/documents/search?query=magic&fields=name,content

# Paginated search
GET /api/documents/search?query=character&limit=50&offset=100

# Folder-scoped search
GET /api/documents/search?query=spell&folder_id=uuid&limit=10

# Multi-language search
GET /api/documents/search?query=dragón&language=spanish
```

**Implementation:** See `_docs/technical/backend/search-architecture.md` for PostgreSQL full-text search details, indexing strategy, and future vector search plans.

## Thread Operations

Thread system provides multi-turn LLM conversations with branching, streaming, and efficient pagination.

### List Threads (GET /api/threads?project_id=:id)

Returns all threads for a given project belonging to the authenticated user.

- Requires `project_id` query parameter (400 if missing).
- Only returns threads where the project belongs to the current user.
- Soft-deleted threads (with `deleted_at` set) are excluded.
- Ordered by `updated_at DESC` (most recently updated first).
- Returns empty array `[]` if no threads exist for the project.

**Response:** Array of Thread objects

```json
[
  {
    "id": "thread-uuid",
    "project_id": "project-uuid",
    "user_id": "user-uuid",
    "title": "Brainstorm: Act 1",
    "last_viewed_turn_id": "turn-uuid-or-null",
    "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-01-15T10:45:12Z"
  }
]
```

### Create Thread (POST /api/threads)

Creates a new thread session within a project.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "project_id": "project-uuid",
  "title": "Brainstorm: Act 1"
}
```

**Validation:**
- `project_id` required (must reference an existing project owned by the user).
- `title` required.
- `title` length: 1-255 characters (see `config.MaxThreadTitleLength`).

**Conflict Handling (409):**
- If a thread with a conflicting title already exists (according to domain rules), returns:
  - HTTP 409 with error message.
  - Response body includes the existing `Thread` resource to allow the frontend to offer "Open existing" flows.

**Response (201 Created):**
```json
{
  "id": "thread-uuid",
  "project_id": "project-uuid",
  "user_id": "user-uuid",
  "title": "Brainstorm: Act 1",
  "last_viewed_turn_id": null,
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Get Thread (GET /api/threads/:id)

Returns a single thread by ID for the authenticated user.

- Validates that the thread exists and belongs to a project owned by the user.
- Returns 404 if not found or not accessible.

**Response:** Thread object (same shape as Create Thread response).

### Update Thread (PATCH /api/threads/:id)

Updates a thread's title.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "title": "Revised Brainstorm: Act 1"
}
```

**Validation:**
- `title` required.
- `title` length: 1-255 characters (`config.MaxThreadTitleLength`).

**Response (200 OK):** Updated Thread object with new `title` and `updated_at`.

### Delete Thread (DELETE /api/threads/:id)

Soft-deletes a thread and returns the deleted thread object.

- Marks `deleted_at` timestamp instead of hard-deleting.
- Deleted threads are excluded from `GET /api/threads` and from conversation operations.
- Returns 404 if thread not found or not accessible.

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "id": "thread-uuid",
  "project_id": "project-uuid",
  "user_id": "user-uuid",
  "title": "Brainstorm: Act 1",
  "last_viewed_turn_id": null,
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-01-15T10:45:12Z",
  "deleted_at": "2025-01-15T11:00:00Z"
}
```

### Create Turn (POST /api/threads/:threadId/turns)

Creates a new **user** turn in a thread and triggers an assistant streaming response.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "prev_turn_id": "uuid-prev-turn-or-null",
  "role": "user",
  "selected_skills": ["skill-name"],
  "turn_blocks": [
    {
      "block_type": "text",
      "text_content": "Write a scene where the hero meets the mentor.",
      "content": {
        "text": "Write a scene where the hero meets the mentor."
      }
    }
  ],
  "request_params": {
    "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2-thinking",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "thinking": "low",
    "system": "Optional user-provided system prompt"
  }
}
```

**System Prompt Resolution:**
System prompts are resolved hierarchically at request time from:
1. `request_params.system` - User-provided system prompt (optional)
2. `project.system_prompt` - Project-level system prompt
3. `thread.system_prompt` - Thread-level system prompt
4. `selected_skills` - Skills loaded from `.skills/{skill_name}/SKILL`

All parts are concatenated with `\n\n` separator.

**Validation:**
- `threadId` path parameter required and must reference a thread owned by the user.
- `role` must be `"user"` (assistant turns are created internally).
- `turn_blocks`:
  - Each block requires `block_type`.
  - Supported types: `text`, `thinking`, `tool_use`, `tool_result`, `image`, `reference`, `partial_reference`.
  - `content` must pass type-specific validation (see `turn-blocks.md`).
- `prev_turn_id` (if provided) must belong to the same thread.

**Response (201 Created):**

Returns both the user turn and the assistant turn that will stream, plus a convenience SSE URL:

```json
{
  "user_turn": {
    "id": "user-turn-uuid",
    "thread_id": "thread-uuid",
    "prev_turn_id": "prev-turn-uuid-or-null",
    "role": "user",
    "status": "complete",
    "blocks": [
      {
        "block_index": 0,
        "block_type": "text",
        "content": {
          "text": "Write a scene where the hero meets the mentor."
        }
      }
    ],
    "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "completed_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "assistant_turn": {
    "id": "assistant-turn-uuid",
    "thread_id": "thread-uuid",
    "prev_turn_id": "user-turn-uuid",
    "role": "assistant",
    "status": "streaming",
    "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2-thinking",
    "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "completed_at": null
  },
  "stream_url": "/api/turns/assistant-turn-uuid/stream"
}
```

**Usage:**
- Frontend persists the returned turns, renders the user turn immediately, and connects to `stream_url` via SSE to receive incremental `block_delta` events for the assistant turn.

### Strategy: Two-Endpoint Pagination

### Strategy: Two-Endpoint Pagination

**Tree Endpoint** - Lightweight structure for cache validation (~2KB for 1000 turns)
**Pagination Endpoint** - Full Turn objects with nested blocks

### Get Thread Tree (GET /api/threads/:id/tree)

⚠️ **Status:** Currently implemented but **debug-only**. Available at `GET /debug/api/threads/:id/tree` in development mode. Not yet exposed as a production API.

Returns lightweight conversation structure with IDs and relationships only (no turn content).

**Use Cases:**
- Cache validation (detect new turns)
- Conversation structure overview
- Quick turn count calculation

**Response:**
```json
{
  "thread_id": "thread-uuid",
  "turns": [
    {
      "id": "turn-1-uuid",
      "prev_turn_id": null,
      "role": "user"
    },
    {
      "id": "turn-2-uuid",
      "prev_turn_id": "turn-1-uuid",
      "role": "assistant"
    },
    {
      "id": "turn-3a-uuid",
      "prev_turn_id": "turn-2-uuid",
      "role": "user"
    },
    {
      "id": "turn-3b-uuid",
      "prev_turn_id": "turn-2-uuid",
      "role": "user"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Performance:**
- ~2KB for 1000 turns
- < 100ms response time
- No nested blocks (IDs only)

**Turn Branching:**
- Multiple turns can reference the same `prev_turn_id` (branching)
- Root turns have `prev_turn_id: null`

### Get Paginated Turns (GET /api/threads/:id/turns)

Returns full Turn objects with nested turn blocks for efficient pagination.

**Query Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `from_turn_id` | UUID | No | `last_viewed_turn_id` | Starting turn for pagination |
| `limit` | Integer | No | 50 | Max turns to return (max 200) |
| `direction` | String | No | "both" | Navigation direction: `before`, `after`, or `both` |

**Direction Modes:**

- **`before`** - Load history (scroll up)
  - Follows `prev_turn_id` chain backwards
  - Returns older turns before `from_turn_id`
  - Use case: Infinite scroll upward

- **`after`** - Load future (scroll down)
  - Follows children forward
  - Picks most recent branch on forks
  - Returns newer turns after `from_turn_id`
  - Use case: Infinite scroll downward

- **`both`** - Context window (initial load)
  - Splits limit **25%/75%** (before/after) - asymmetric split favors future context
  - 25% for history (older turns)
  - 75% for continuation (newer turns)
  - Centers view around `from_turn_id`
  - Use case: Opening thread to last viewed turn
  - **Rationale:** Users typically care more about seeing the continuation than past history

**Validation:**
- `limit` must be <= 200 (see `MaxPaginationLimit`)
- `direction` must be one of: `before`, `after`, `both`
- `from_turn_id` must exist in the thread (if provided)
- If `from_turn_id` omitted, uses `thread.last_viewed_turn_id`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "turns": [
    {
      "id": "turn-uuid",
      "thread_id": "thread-uuid",
      "prev_turn_id": "prev-turn-uuid",
      "role": "user",
      "status": "complete",
      "blocks": [
        {
          "block_index": 0,
          "block_type": "text",
          "content": {
            "text": "Write a story about dragons"

```

**Response Fields:**
- `turns` - Array of Turn objects with nested blocks
- `has_more_before` - Boolean indicating more history available
- `has_more_after` - Boolean indicating more future turns available
- `from_turn_id` - Starting turn used for pagination (for debugging)

**Turn Block Types:**

**User blocks:**
- `text` - Plain text message
- `image` - Image attachment
- `reference` - Full document reference
- `partial_reference` - Document text selection
- `tool_result` - Tool execution result

**Assistant blocks:**
- `text` - LLM response text
- `thinking` - Extended thinking (Claude only)
- `tool_use` - Tool invocation request

See [turn-blocks.md](../thread/turn-blocks.md) for detailed JSONB schemas.

**Example Requests:**

```bash
# Initial load - get 50 turns around last viewed position
GET /api/threads/abc-123/turns

# Load 100 more history turns
GET /api/threads/abc-123/turns?from_turn_id=turn-xyz&limit=100&direction=before

# Load next 50 turns in conversation
GET /api/threads/abc-123/turns?from_turn_id=turn-xyz&limit=50&direction=after

# Get 200 turns centered around specific turn
GET /api/threads/abc-123/turns?from_turn_id=turn-xyz&limit=200&direction=both
```

**Performance Optimization:**

Backend avoids N+1 queries by:
1. Fetching turn IDs via pagination algorithm
2. Bulk loading all turns in single query
3. Bulk loading all turn blocks in single query (sorted by turn_id, block_index)
4. Assembling in-memory

See [pagination.md](../thread/pagination.md) for backend implementation details.

## Validation Rules Summary

| Entity   | Slash Allowed? | Max Length | Reason                                    |
|----------|----------------|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Projects | N/A            | 255        | Top-level container                       |
| Folders  | ✅ CREATE only (path notation) / ❌ UPDATE | 255 | Path notation for CREATE, simple names for UPDATE |
| Documents| ✅ CREATE only (path notation) / ❌ UPDATE | 255 | Path notation for CREATE, simple names for UPDATE |

**Implementation notes:**
- **CREATE operations**: `name` field supports Unix-style path notation (`a/b/c` or `/a/b/c`)
  - Path notation auto-creates intermediate folders
  - Final segment must be valid simple name (no slashes)
  - Strict validation: no `//`, no trailing `/`, no empty segments
- **UPDATE operations**: Simple names only (no slashes), regex: `^[^/]+$`
- **Import**: Automatically sanitizes slashes to hyphens in document names

### Parent Resource Validation

All create operations validate that parent resources exist and are not soft-deleted. See [Error Responses](error-responses.md#404-not-found) for validation behavior and error examples.

## Error Responses

### Standard Error Format

Most errors return a simple JSON object:
```json
{
  "error": "Human-readable error message"
}
```

### Conflict Errors (409)

**For creation conflicts** (duplicate documents, folders, or projects), the response includes structured details about the existing resource:

```json
{
  "error": "document 'Chapter 1' already exists in this location",
  "conflict": {
    "type": "duplicate",
    "resource_type": "document",
    "resource_id": "uuid-of-existing-document",
    "location": "/api/documents/uuid-of-existing-document"
  }
}
```

**For other conflicts** (e.g., folder not empty, project has documents), returns simple error format:
```json
{
  "error": "folder contains 3 documents"
}
```

**Frontend handling:**
- Validation errors (400): display specific server message
- Server errors (500): generic error messaging with retry
- Conflict errors (409): can fetch existing resource via `conflict.resource_id` or `conflict.location` if provided

## Frontend Expectations

**Phase 1 (Single-User):**
- Frontend updates optimistically; backend validates and persists
- Content edits: don't rollback on error (keep local, retry)
- Structural ops: rollback on 400/409 and show server message

**See:** Frontend state management documentation

## Path Computation

Both folders and documents include a computed `path` field in responses.

**What the path contains:**
- **Folders:** Full hierarchical path including the folder's own name
  - Example: Folder "Cities" in "World Building/Locations" -> `path: "World Building/Locations/Cities"`
  - Root folder "Characters" -> `path: "Characters"`
- **Documents:** Full hierarchical path including the document's own name
  - Example: Document "Eldergrove" in "World Building/Locations/Cities" -> `path: "World Building/Locations/Cities/Eldergrove"`
  - Root document "Quick Notes" -> `path: "Quick Notes"`

**Path format:**
- Uses `/` as separator
- Starts from project root (no leading `/`)
- Includes the entity's own name as the final segment
- Not stored in database (computed on-demand via recursive CTE)

**Implementation:** The path is computed by walking up the folder hierarchy from the entity to the root, concatenating folder names with `/` separators. See `internal/repository/postgres/docsystem/folder.go:GetPath()` and `internal/repository/postgres/docsystem/document.go:GetPath()`.

## Special Cases

### Empty Folder Deletion

Folders must be empty before deletion (no subfolders or documents).

On attempted deletion, if the folder contains subfolders or documents the server returns a conflict error.

### Circular Reference Prevention

Backend prevents moving folder to be a child of its own descendant.

**Example:** Cannot move "World Building" into "World Building/Characters"

Moves that would create circular references are rejected with a validation error.

## Model Capabilities

Provides model capability metadata for UI rendering and provider selection.

### Get Model Capabilities (GET /api/models/capabilities)

Returns available models grouped by provider, filtered by configured API keys.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "id": "anthropic",
      "name": "Anthropic",
      "models": [

                "output_price": {"text": 4.00}
              }
            ]
          }
        }

            "thinking": true
          },
          "pricing": {
            "input_per_1m": 0.20,
            "output_per_1m": 0.50,
            "tiers": [
              {
                "threshold": null,
                "input_price": {"text": 0.20},
                "output_price": {"text": 0.50}
              },
              {
                "threshold": 128000,
                "input_price": {"text": 0.40},
                "output_price": {"text": 1.00}
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Pricing Structure:**
- `input_per_1m`/`output_per_1m`: First tier's text modality price (backward compatible, simple access)
- `tiers`: Full pricing structure with thresholds and modality support
  - `threshold: null`: No upper limit (applies to all context sizes, or to context size below next tier)
  - `threshold: 128000`: Price changes at 128K tokens
  - Modalities: Currently only `"text"`, future support for `"audio"`, `"image"` output
- Tiers are ordered by threshold (lowest to highest)

**Behavior:**
- Only returns providers with configured API keys (e.g., if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not set, Anthropic provider is omitted)
- Capability data loaded from embedded YAML files in `backend/internal/capabilities/config/`
- No authentication required (public endpoint)

**Use Cases:**
- Frontend model selector dropdowns
- Displaying model capabilities and pricing
- Feature availability detection
- Cost calculation with tier-aware pricing
