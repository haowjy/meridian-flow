## Featured Future Features

### [Block-Level Branching](./block-level-branching.md)
**Status:** Well-defined, ready for implementation
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Priority:** Medium

Enable users to branch conversations from any block in an assistant turn. Allows interrupting mid-thinking, mid-tool-use, or mid-response to explore alternative directions.

**Use cases:**
- "Stop using that tool, try a different approach"
- "Don't overthink this, just answer"
- Fork conversation to explore multiple paths

**Implementation:** Requires `branch_from_block_id` column, message building updates, and frontend UI.
