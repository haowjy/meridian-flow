# Implementation Plans

This directory contains detailed implementation plans for features currently in development or ready to be built.

## Organization

Each plan document includes:
- **Problem statement** - What we're solving and why
- **Current state** - What works, what's missing
- **Architecture context** - How it fits into existing systems
- **Implementation plan** - Phased approach with code examples
- **Testing strategy** - Test cases and verification steps
- **Success criteria** - How we know it's done

## Active Plans

- `fb-event-driven-refresh-framework.md` - Event-driven refresh + 30s polling fallback.
- `fb-tree-ai-suggestions-banner-accept-all.md` - Tree banner listing AI suggestions + project-wide accept all.
- `fb-wikilinks-and-internal-links.md` - Wikilinks + markdownlink interop + `@` insertion + LLM edit-tool guidance.
- `fb-artifact-templates-and-project-instances.md` - Templates (public/user) copied into project-owned instances for shared-safe runtime loading.
- `fb-project-skills-v1-and-artifact-foundations.md` - Project skills now, with schema/namespaces ready for sessions/personas/agents and exports.
- `fb-remove-document-slugs.md` - ✅ Complete: Documents now use exact path addressing (slug column removed).
