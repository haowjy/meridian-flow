# Runtime probes

Use these recipes to check the running product, in addition to `pnpm check`.
Keep evidence in the active work directory, not in this repository. Record the
commit, date, stack/provider, outcome, and evidence path after each run. A recipe
is not a claim that it passed on the current commit.

- [Runtime protocols](runtime-probes.md): RP-1 through RP-12, driven with `./mf`.
- [Draft review](draft-review.md): visual editor and review workflows.
- [Catalog sidebar](catalog-sidebar.md): rename, move, delete, and loaded/fresh-profile convergence.
- [Debugging](../debugging.md): CLI reference, logs, and model-request inspection.
- [CI quality groups](../../tools/ci/README.md): partition coverage and required-status failure propagation.

## Script-backed checks

On-demand checks can be automated scripts, with Markdown documenting setup,
assertions, evidence and cleanup. They are not part of `pnpm test:all`; keep
browser scenarios in the configured-case inventory and list standalone
workloads separately. A missing prerequisite or skipped check is not a pass.

- `pnpm smoke:app-dev-transform`: [dev startup and public routes](../../tools/dev/smoke-app-dev-transform.ts).
- `pnpm smoke:prod-boot`: [production build, startup and public routes](../../tools/dev/smoke-app-prod-boot.ts). Both boot checks also run in CI; neither verifies authenticated writing.
- `bash tools/deploy/smoke-check.sh`: [staging health](../../tools/deploy/smoke-check.sh). Requires `STAGING_URL`; without it the script exits successfully without probing.
- `CHAT_SMOKE_TURNS=200 pnpm exec playwright test --config apps/app/e2e/playwright.chat-smoke.config.ts`: [chat virtualization](../../apps/app/e2e/chat-performance-smoke.pw.ts). Supply the owned app URL and database URL; a missing database skips the scenario. Capture the runner report and trace.
- [Project repository smoke](../../tools/dev/smoke-project-domain.ts) is not recommended on a shared database: it deletes a fixed project UUID before seeding. It needs run-scoped fixture ownership before becoming a safe catalog entry.

Large-chapter editing, image-in-table layout and browser first-send/concurrent
editing recovery still lack dedicated, cataloged script-backed writer checks.
The recipes below and in linked pages do not certify those workflows today.
Script automation and catalog repairs are tracked in [#726](https://github.com/haowjy/meridian-flow/issues/726).

Run on an owned worktree and database. Discover HTTPS routes with
`pnpm portless:list`; never target another worktree's process or clear its mock
queue. Stop only your stack with `pnpm dev --stop` when finished.

## Before you call it a defect

Two harness races have produced false defects. Rule them out first.

- **Persistence.** Before judging whether an edit saved, wait until the
  server route's `/readyz` returns 200 and the browser's authenticated
  `/ws/yjs` WebSocket upgrades with 101 (CDP `Network.webSocket*` events).
  Read the result back with `./mf doc read <uri>` or a fresh browser profile,
  never the browser that made the edit: its IndexedDB shows the edit whether or
  not the server has it. A stack restarted after a port collision is the usual
  cause.
- **Scripted copy.** After a scripted selection (`locator.selectText()`), wait
  about 100 ms before Ctrl+C so ProseMirror's selection catches up. Otherwise
  the editor's copy handler sees an empty selection and Chromium does a native
  copy, which carries none of the app's clipboard data. Assert the holder
  document's URI before testing copy and paste between documents.

## Device reading memory

[Remember a chapter’s place](reading-position.md) covers reload, shared Editor/side-panel memory, collaborative edits and explicit-target precedence.
