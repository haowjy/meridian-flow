There is no deceleration; readers lose roughly 40 minutes of story time in a single paragraph break.\n\nThe bell motif from Chapter 14 is your natural bridge. It already carries associations of forced stillness (Mara hates the bell but obeys it), so reintroducing it here would give her body a reason to transition: she hears the bell, has to stop mid-swing, and the physical comedown becomes the emotional comedown. One paragraph of 90–120 words should be enough — any longer and you risk over-explaining what the reader can feel.",

Mara let the practice sword drop to her side. Somewhere a dove resettled. The yard was loud with absence now — no feet on packed earth, no counted breath but her own — and into that quiet the evening bell spoke once. She wiped her palm on the wrap at her wrist, set the sword across the post, and followed the sound through the gate.\n\n**Option B — Body-led:**\nHer wrist unlocked first. Then her shoulders, then the long muscles along her spine, each releasing in the order her instructor had drilled years before the yard existed. Mara stood the practice sword against the post and pressed both palms flat on the wood until the grain bit her skin and she was certain her hands were her own again. Sweat cooled at her temples. A dove called from the eaves. When the evening bell struck she was already turning toward the covered walk, her breathing settled into the four-count rhythm the monastery demanded of everyone who entered.",
